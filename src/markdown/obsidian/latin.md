# Book 1 Aeneid (Aug 2022)
1. I sing of arms and of a man, who, first, made fugitive
2. by fate from the shores of Troy, came to Italy and the Lavinian coasts,
3. he having been tossed much in both lands and deep [sea]
4. by strength of the high ones on account of the remembering ire of savage Juno,
5. and also suffering many things in war, until he founds a city
6. and carries in to Latium the gods; from which the Latin race
7. and the fathers of Alba Longa and the walls of tall Rome [originate].
8. Muse, relate to me the reasons, with what offended divinity,
9. or resenting what, the queen of gods struck the man, distinguished in piety,
10. to undergo so many misfortunes, to approach so many labors.
11. Are angers so great [fit] for celestial minds?
12. There was an ancient city Carthage (Tyrian colonists inhabited it),
13. far from Italy and the Tiber's mouths,
14. prosperous in wealth and fierce in pursuits of war,
15. the sole [city] which Juno was said to have cherished
16. more than all lands with [even] Samos esteemed less. Here were her arms,
17. here was [her] chariot; further now the goddess, if in any way the fates should allow it,
18. both tended and cherished this [city] to be the ruling power of [all] nations.
19. For she had even heard that a Progeny was produced from Trojan blood
20. who would soon demolish Tyrian citadels
21. [and that] from here the people, widely ruling and proud in war,
22. would come for the destruction of Libya; thus the Fates turn.
23. Saturn's daughter, fearing this and remembering of the ancient war,
24. which as chief she had waged against Troy for the beloved Argives--
25. for the causes of rages and fierce pains had not yet
26. fell from [her] mind; the decision of Paris, and injury of rejected beauty,
27. and the hated race, and the grace of the snatched up Ganymede
28. remains stored up in [her] deep mind:
29. Moreover, Juno, enraged by these, kept far from Latium
30. the remaining Trojans of the Greeks and fierce Achilles,
31. tossed about on the entire sea; and through many years
32. they lingered, driven by fate around all seas.
33. To found the Roman clan was of so great difficulty!
34. Hardly out of sight of Sicilian land, on the sea
35. the happy [Trojans] were giving sails and rushing on foams of salt with bronze [stern],
36. when Juno, guarding everlasting injury under her breast,
37. said these [words] to herself: "Am I, defeated, to desist from [my] undertaking,
38. and to not be able to keep the king of the Teucrians away from Italy?
39. Indeed I am prevented by the fates! Was Pallas [not] able to burn up
40. the Argive fleet and sink them in the sea
41. on account of the crime and rages of one Ajax of Oileus?
42. She, hurling the swift fire of Jove from the clouds,
43. scattered the ships and overturned the seas with winds;
44. In a storm she snatched him, breathing flames from [his] pierced chest,
45. and impaled [him] upon sharp stone;
46. but I, who walks as the queen of gods and
47. both sister and wife of Jove, [must] wage war with one clan
48. for so many years. And hereafter, whoever would honor the will of Juno
49. or, suppliant, place upon the altars a sacrifice?"
50. The goddess, pondering such things with inflamed heart,
51. came to Aeolus in the homeland of clouds, a place teeming with
52. raging south winds. Here, in a vast cavern, king Aeolus
53. controlled by command and restrained with chains and prison
54. the struggling winds and roaring tempests.
55. The angry winds murmur with great rumbling
56. around the barriers of the mountain; Holding his scepters, Aeolus sits
57. in his high citadel and soothes their spirits and calms their rages.
58. Should he not do this, the swift winds would surely sweep through the breezes
59. and carry off with them the seas and lands and high sky.
60. But fearing this, the all-powerful father (Jupiter) had hid them
61. in dark caves and placed above them a mass of tall mountains[^61],
62. and he gave this to a king who, with treaty fixed,
63. knew to both control and to put free the reigns [when] ordered.
64. To him humble Juno then used these words:
65. "Aeolus (as to you the father of gods and king of men
66. has granted [the prerogative] to both calm and stir up waves with wind),
67. an clan enemy to me sails the Tyrrhenian sea,
68. carrying Ilium and vanquished idols into Italy:
69. strike violence into the winds and crush their sunk ships,
70. or drive the scattered [Trojans] and disperse their bodies in the sea.
71. Twice-seven Nymphs with excellent body are mine,
72. of which the one with the most beautiful form is Deiopea,
73. whom I would join [to you] in lasting wedlock and dedicate as your own
74. so that she would pass all years with you on account of such merits[^74]
75. and make you a parent to beautiful offspring."
76. Aeolus says these words in response: "O queen, your duty is to examine
77. what you wish for; it is right for me to undertake orders.
78. You unite for me whatever this is of a kingdom, you win over
79. scepters and Jove, you grant [me the privilege] to recline at feasts of gods,
80. and you make [me] powerful over clouds and tempests."
81. When these [words] were said, he struck the hollow mountain
82. with reversed spear in the side; and the winds, just as with a column formed,
83. where a gate was given, rush forward and blow through lands in a whirlwind.
84. They brooded over the sea and together Eurus, Notus, and Africus thick with gusts,
85. rush upon the whole [Earth] from the lowest bottoms
86. and overturn huge waves towards the shores.
87. Both the shouts of men and the creaking of ropes follow.
88. Suddenly clouds snatch away both the sky and day
89. from the eyes of the Teucrians; a black night lies over the sea;
90. The heavens thundered, and the ether flashes with frequent fires,
91. And all things intend instant death for [these] men.
92. Immediately the cold limbs of Aeneas are loosened;
93. he groans and, stretching both hands to the stars,
94. he relates such things with [his] voice: "O thrice and four-times blessed,
95. to whom it befell to meet [death] before the faces of [our] fathers
96. beneath the tall walls of Troy! O the bravest Tydides of the clan
97. of the Greeks! Had I not been able to die in the Trojan fields
98. and pour out this life with your right hand,
99. when fierce Hector lies [slain] by the weapon of the Aecidian Achilles, when
100. the great Sarpedon [lies dead], when the Simois [river] turns under waves
101. so many snatched up shields and helmets of men and brave bodies!"
102. To him yelling such things, an adverse wind roaring with Aquilo[^102]
103. strikes the sail and lifts the waves to the stars.
104. The oars are broken, then prow turns away and gives to the waves
105. the flank, a towering mountain of water follows in a heap.
106. These men hang on the top of the wave; for them a gaping wave
107. reveals the land between the waves, the surge rages with the sands.
108. The south wind whirls three seized ships into lurking rocks,
109. (the Italians call these rocks which are in the middle of waves the Altars,
110. an immense reef at the top of the sea), and the east wind forces
111. three ships from deep sea into the shallows and the reefs, horrible to see,
112. dashes them against the shoals and encircles them with a mound of sand.
113. Before his[^113] own eyes, the great sea beats from the top into one ship,
114. which was carrying the Lycians and loyal Orontes:
115. and headlong, the pilot is cast out and turned onto [his] head,
116. but thrice the the wave whirls the [ship] in the same place,
117. driving it around, and the consuming whirlpool swallows it in the sea.
118. In the vast whirlpool, scattered, swimming men,
119. the arms of men, planks, and Trojan treasure appear through the waves.
120. Now the storm vanquishes the mighty ship of Ilioneus, now that of brave Achates,
121. and that on which Abas was carried, and that on which aged Aletes.
122. All ships take on hostile water through the loose seams of the flanks,
123. and they split open at the cracks.
124. Meanwhile, Neptune, greatly disturbed, sensed that the sea was stirred
125. with great roaring, and that the storm had been sent forth,
126. and that the waters had been poured back from the lowest shallows,
127. and looking out onto the deep, he lifted up his calm head from the top of the waves.
128. He sees the ships of Aeneas scattered on the whole sea
129. and the Trojans overwhelmed by the waves and the downfall of heaven.
130. And the wiles and angers of Juno do not escape the notice of the brother.
131. He calls Eurus and Zephrus to himself and then says such things:
132. "Did such a great confidence of your kind hold you?
133. Now, oh winds, do you dare to mix the sky and the land
134. without my will, and to lift masses so great?
135. Y'all I-- But it is better to calm the moved waves.
136. Afterwards for me you will atone for the crimes with not similar punishment.
137. Hasten your flight and say these words to your king:
138. That command of the sea and the fierce trident
139. was given not to him, but to me. He holds huge stones,
140. your homes, Eurus; Let Aeolus hurl himself[^140] about in that hall,
141. and let him reign in the enclosed prison of winds."
142. Thus he speaks, and more quickly than a word, he calms the swollen seas,
143. and puts to flight the gathered winds and leads back the sun.
144. Together Symothoe and Trion, having striven, dislodge
145. the ships from the sharp rock; he himself lifts them with his trident
146. and opens the vast reefs and controls the sea
147. and glides over the tops of waves with swift wheels.
148. And just as when a sedition often arose in a large population,
149. and the inglorious crowd rages with spirit
150. and then torches and stones fly, the madness supplies the arms;
151. then, if by chance they caught sight of some[^151] man
152. venerable in piety and merits, they grow silent and stand with raised ears;
153. he rules [their] spirits with words and soothes [their] breasts:
154. Thus the entire uproar of the sea subsided, after that, the father,
155. looking out on the seas, carried on open sky, guides the horses, and,
156. flying, gives reigns to the favorable chariot.
157. The tired men of Aeneas strive to seek with [their] course
158. the shores which [were] nearest, and they are turned to the coasts of Libya.
159. The location is in a long inlet: the island forms a port
160. with a projection of the sides, with which every wave from the deep sea
161. is broken and splits itself into folded back bays.
162. From this side and that, the vast cliffs tower in the sky
163. [along with] twin rocks, under the summit of which the protected seas
164. stand still widely; then from above [there is] a scene with quivering forests,
165. and a black grove hangs over [them] with trembling shadows.
166. Under the opposite front, [there was] a cave with hanging rocks;
167. within [there were] sweet waters and seats [made] from living stone,
168. the home of Nymphs. Here not any chains hold the tired ships,
169. no anchor binds [them] with a curved bite.
170. With seven ships collected out of the whole number,
171. Aeneas enters here; and with a great love of the land the Trojans,
172. having disembarked, gain the wished-for sands and,
173. soaking with seawater, they place [their] limbs on the shore.
174. And Achates first strikes out a fire with flint
175. and catches up fire in leaves and placed
176. dry fuels around and seized a flame in shaving.
177. Then the men, tired of things, prepare the spoiled Ceres (grain)
178. and the Cerelian arms, they prepare to roast
179. the recovered grains with flames and to crush them with rock.
180. Meanwhile, Aeneas climbs a cliff and seeks every view
181. on the sea, if he should see Anthea, who was tossed by wind,
182. [or] the Phrygian biremes, or Capys,
183. or the arms of Caicus in towering ships.
184. He sees no ship in sight, [but instead] three lingering stags
185. on the shore; entire herds follow them from the rear,
186. and the long column grazes through the valleys.
187. Here he stopped, and he snatched up in his hand the bow
188. and swift arrows, weapons which loyal Achates was carrying,
189. and first he lays low the leaders themselves carrying [their] heads high
190. with branching horns, and then he mixes the whole crowd,
191. driving with weapons the mob between leafy forests;
192. Nor did he stop before he, [as] victor, should pour the seven huge bodies
193. on the ground and makes the number equal with the ships;
194. From here he seeks the port and distributes [it] in all [his] comrades.
195. He divides the wine which the good hero Acestes had loaded in jars
196. and had given to those departing from the Sicilian shore,
197. and he soothes gloomy breasts with [these] words:
198. "O comardes (for we are not ignorant of previous misfortunes),
199. O those having suffered worse things, god will give an end to these [troubles] too.
200. You approached both the fury of Scylla and the deeply sounding rocks,
201. and you experienced the Cyclopean rocks:
202. call back [your] spirits and send away gloomy fear;
203. perhaps soon it will please you to have remembered these things.
204. Through varied misfortunes, through so many crises of things,
205. we stretch into Latium, where the fates promise peaceful seats;
206. there, it is divinely right that the kingdoms of Troy rise.
207. Endure, and save yourselves for favorable matters."
208. He speaks such things with [his] voice and sick with huge cares,
209. he simulates hope in [his] face, and presses pain deep in [his] heart.

418. Meanwhile, they took up the way, by which the path points.
419. And now, they were ascending the hill, which, highest, hangs over
420. the city and faces the opposite hills from above.
421. Aeneas admires the mass, formerly huts,
422. he admires the gates and uproar and pavement of the roads.
423. The eager Tyrians press on: part to extend the walls and
424. make a citadel and to roll up stones with [their] hands,
425. part to choose a location for a house and enclose [it] with a ditch;
426. They choose laws and magistrates and a revered senate.
427. Here some excavate ports; there others establish
428. deep foundations for theaters, they cut out from the cliffs
429. immense columns, tall ornaments for future stages.
430. Just as work busies bees in the new summer
431. through the flowery countryside under the sun, when they lead forth
432. the adult offspring of the clan, or when they stuff the flowing honeys
433. and stretch the cells with sweet nectar, or [when] they receive
434. the burden of those coming, or, with a column formed,
435. they keep from the hive the lazy swarm, the drones;
436. the work glows and the fragrant honeys smell of thyme.
437. "O fortunate ones, the walls of whom now rise!"
438. Aeneas says, and looks upon the summit of the city.
439. He brings himself in, inclosed in a cloud (marvelous to say),
440. through the middle, and mingles with men and is not discerned by any.

<hr/>

494. While these things were seeming[^494] marvelous to Dardanian Aeneas,
495. while he stood dazed and clung, fixed in one view,
496. the queen, Dido beautiful in form, marched towards the temple,
497. with a great crowd of young men crowding about.
498. Just as on the shores of Eurota or through the mountain ridges of Cynthus
499. Diana trains bands, having followed whom a thousand Oreads
500. gather together here and there; she bears a quiver
501. on [her] shoulder, and proceeding, [she] towers above all goddesses/nymphs
502. (The joys master the speechless breast of Latona):
503. Such was Dido; she, happy, was carrying herself such
504. through the middle, urging on the work and the future kingdoms.
505. Then in the gates of goddesses, in the middle [of the] dome of the temple,
506. enclosed in arms and resting loftily on a throne, she sat.
507. She was giving laws and decrees to men, and she was equalizing
508. the labor of the works with fair parts or was drawing [them] with a lot:
509. when suddenly Aeneas sees that in a great crowd,
510. Anteus, Sergestus, and brave Cloanthus and
511. others of the Trojans approach, whom a black storm
512. had scattered in the sea and had carried away deeply to other shores[^512].
513. Together he himself, together astounded Achates stood agape
514. both with joy and with fear; eager, they were burning to join
515. [their] right [hands], but the unknown matter disturbs [their] minds.
516. They hide within a hollow cloud and, wrapped up, they spy out
517. what fortune [is to be] for [these] men, on what shore they leave their fleet,
518. and why they come; the [men] chosen from all the ships were proceeding,
519. and praying for grace, they were seeking the temple with clamor.
520. After they entered and permission of speaking openly was given,
521. great Ilioneus began with a calm heart thusly:
522. "O queen, to whom Jupiter granted [the opportunity] to found a new city
523. and to restrain haughty clans with justice,
524. we miserable Trojans, carried about all seas by the winds,
525. beg you: keep away the unspeakable fires from [our] ships,
526. spare [this] pious clan and inspect our cases more closely.
527. We did not come to either plunder Libyan gods with iron,
528. or to turn towards the shore seized spoils;
529. That violence is not in mind, nor is such haughtiness for the conquered.
530. There is a place, Greeks call it Hesperia by nickname,
531. an ancient land, powerful in arms and in fertility of earth;
532. the Oenotrian men cultivated it; now the rumor is that they had called
533. the descendants the Italian race after the name of the leader.
534. This was our course,[^534]
535. When suddenly stormy Orion, rising up on a wave,
536. brought [us] into dark shallows and, with the sea overpowering [us],
537. wholly dispersed [us] both through waves and through pathless rocks;
538. Here, few [of us] swam to your shores.
539. What is this nation of men? Or what such uncivilized country allows
540.  [this] custom? We are held back from the welcome of sand;
541. wars stir up and they forbid [us] to settle on first land.
542. If you scorn the race of humans and mortal arms,
543. at least expect that gods [are] remembering of good and evil.
544. Aeneas was king for us, than whom another was
545. neither more righteous in piety nor greater in war and arms.
546. If the fates save which man, if he feeds upon ethereal air
547. and till now does not lie dead with cruel shadows,
548. no fear [est], and it would not pain prior you to have vied
549. for kindness.[^549] And in the Sicilian regions there are cities
550. and arms and illustrious Acestes from Trojan blood.
551. Let it be allowed [for us] to beach [our] ship shaken by winds
552. and to equip beams from forests and to carve out oars,
553. if [permission] is given to the comrades to stretch for Italy
554. with the king recovered, so that we, happy, may seek Italy and Latium;
555. But if safety was taken away, and the sea of Libya has you,
556. excellent father of Teucreans, and now no hope of Iulus[^556] remains,
557. still at least let us seek the straits of Sicily and ready seats,
558. from which [we were] carried away to here, and [let us seek] king Acestes."
559. With such [words] Ilioneus [spoke]; every Trojan murmured
560. with a [singular] voice at once.[^560]
561. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then briefly Dido, having let down [her] face, speaks:
562. "Free fear from [your] heart, Teucrians, and shut off your cares.
563. The harsh state and newness of [my] kingdom force me to undertake
564. such things and to protect the borders widely with the guard.
565. Who [does not know] the clan of the Aeneans, who does not know the city of Troy,
566. and the valors and men or the conflagrations of such war?
567. We Phoenicians do not bear such dull hearts,
568. nor does the Sun, having been turned away, join [his] horses so [far] from the city.
569. Whether you choose great Italy and the Saturnalian fields
570. or the borders of Eryx and king Acestes,
571. I will send [you] down, safe by [my] help, and I will help with resources.
572. And do you wish to settle side-by-side with me in these kingdoms?
573. The city[^573] which I found is yours; take up [your] ships;
574. Trojans and Tyrians will be conducted by me with no danger.
575. And, oh that king Aeneas himself, compelled by the same south wind,
576. were present! Indeed I will send down reliable [men] through the shores,
577. and I will order [them] to survey the boundaries of Libya,
578. if he was cast out in some other forests or cities."

40. First there before all, with a great troop following,
41. ardent Laocoon runs down from the highest citadel,
42. and far off [he cries] "O miserable citizens, what insanity so great [is this]?
43. Do you trust that the enemies [were] carried off? Or do you think that any
44. gifts are lacking from the deceits of the Greeks? [Is] Ulysses known thusly?
45. Either the Greeks are hidden, enclosed with this wood,
46. or this engine was fashioned against (into) our walls,
47. about to look into homes and come from above to the city,
48. or some trick lies [hidden]; do not trust the horse, you Teucrians.
49. Whatever this is, I fear Greeks, even (et=>etiam) bearing gifts.
50. Having spoken thus, with mighty strengths he hurled a great spear
51. into the side and into the belly of the beast, curved with joints.
52. Trembling, it stood, and with the womb echoing,
53. the hollows resounded and the cavities gave a groan.
54. And, if the utterances of gods [had not been that way], if the mind had not been unlucky,
55. he [would have?] [^55] driven to mangle the Greek lairs,
56. and Troy would now stand, and you, O high citadel of Priam, would remain.

201. Laocoon, chosen [as] priest to Neptune by lot,
202. sacrificed a huge bull at the solemn altars.
203. But behold twin snakes with immense coils from Tenedos
204. (I shudder referencing [this]) through the calm deep [seas]
205. hang over the sea, and side-by-side they stretch towards the shores;
206. And whose breasts, raised between the waves, and blood-red
207. crests overcome the waves, the other part skims
208. the sea behind and folds [their] immense backs with a coil.
209. The sound arises with the sea foaming; and now they beheld the fields,
210. and, suffused with blood and fire with respect to [their] burning eyes[^GRK],
211. they licked their hissing mouths with vibrating tongue.
212. Pale, we flee from sight. They, with fixed path,
213. seek Laocoon; and first, having embraced the small bodies
214. of both sons, each serpent entwines
215. and devours the wretched limbs with a bite;
216. Afterwards, they snatch up he himself, coming for help
217. and brining weapons, and bind [him] with giant coils; and now,
218. having twice enfolded the middle, having twice placed scaly
219. backs[^219] around [his] neck, overcome with the head and tall necks.
220. He not only strives to tear apart the knots with [his] hands,
221. drenched with gore and black venom with respect to [priestly] headbands[^221],
222. but at the same time lifts horrible screams to the stars:
223. [it was] such a roar [as] when a wounded bull fled the altar
224. and shook off the uncertain ax from its neck.
225. And the twin dragons flee to the greatest temples with gliding
226. and seek the citadel of savage Minerva, and under the feet
227. of the goddess and under circle of the shield, they are hidden.
228. Then truly a new terror creeps through appalled breasts
229. for the whole [peoples], and they say that deserving Laocoon
230. paid for [his] crime, who struck the sacred oak with [his] spear
231. and hurled the wicked spear against the back.
232. They exclaim that the [horse's] image is to be led to the abodes
233. and [that] the wills of the goddesses are to be begged for.
234. We divide the walls and open the defenses of the city.
235. All equip [themselves] for the work and put glidings of
236. wheels under the feet, and they stretch rope chains
237. from the neck: the fatal machine, pregnant with arms,
238. scales the walls. Around, boys and virgin girls sing
239. sacred [songs] and rejoice to touch the rope with [their] hand.
240. It enters, and towering, it glides in the middle of the city.
241. O fatherland, O home of Trojan gods and the walls of the Dardanians
242. renowned in war! Four times it halted in the that threshold of the gate,
243. and four times the weapons gave a sound from the belly;
244. However we press on, heedless and blind by madness,
245. and we stop the unlucky monster at the consecrated citadel.
246. Then even Cassandra opens [her] mouths with future fates,
247. not ever trusted by Teucrians by the order of a god.
248. We miserable ones, for whom that day was the last,
249. deck the temples of the gods with festive branch through the city.

268. It was the time, during which the first rest begins for tired mortals,
269. and the most pleasing [sleep] creeps on from the gift of the gods.
270. In dreams, behold, before [my] eyes the most gloomy Hector
271. seemed to appear to me and pour out copious tears,
272. carried off by chariots as once [he was], both black with
273. bloody dust and pierced through [his] swollen feet with a leather strap.[^GRK]
274. Alas, to me he was as such, transformed so greatly from that Hector
275. who returned, donned with the spoils of Achilles[^GRK]
276. or having hurled the Trojan fires towards the ships of the Greeks;
277. Wearing a dirty beard, and hairs matted with blood, and those
278. wounds, many which he received near the fatherland's walls.
279. Weeping further, I myself seemed to accost
280. the man and to await gloomy voices:
281. "O light of Troy, O the most faithful hope of the Trojans,
282. what great delays hold you? O expected Hector, from what
283. shores do you come? How gladly we tired ones see you after the
284. many funerals of your [men], after the various labors both of men
285. and of the city! What unworthy cause has mangled
286. [your] calm faces? Or why do I see these wounds?"
287. He says nothing lest a false [thing] delays me searching,
288. but leading [out] groans heavily deep [from his] chest,
289. "Alas, flee, goddess-born," he says "rescue yourself from these flames.
290. The enemy has the walls; Troy rushes from the high peak.
291. Enough was given to the fatherland and Priam: if the citadels were able
292. to be defended by right [hand], she still would have been defended by this.
293. Troy entrusts to you the sacred [things] and its own household gods;
294. take these comrades of the fates, seek great walls for them,
295. which you will finally establish with the sea wandered."
296. Thus he speaks and lifts the garlands and the powerful Vesta
297. and the eternal fire from the inmost shrines.

<hr/>

559. And then first a fierce horror surrounds me.
560. I stood agape; the likeness of [my] dear father comes to mind,
561. as I saw the equal-aged king because of a cruel wound,
562. breathing out life, deserted Creusa (wife of Aeneas) comes to mind,
563. and the ravaged home and the case of small Julus.
564. I look back and survey the the supply which was around me.
565. All the tired ones deserted, and with a leap, they threw
566. [their] sick bodies to the Earth or gave [themselves] to fires.
567. {And now so much as I alone survive, when behold the
568. daughter of Tyndarus, saving the thresholds of Vesta and
569. lying silent at the secret seat; the blazes give clear light for those
570. passing by everywhere and carrying [their] eyes through the whole [scene].
571. She, fearing the Teucrians, hostile to her on account of the
572. destroyed citadels, and [fearing] the punishment of the Greeks and the ire
573. of the deserted husband, [as] the Curse of the Trojans and of the fatherland,
574. [she] had hid herself and, hated [by all], sat at the altars.
575. Fires blaze up in [my] heart; a rage comes upon me to avenge
576. the dying homeland and to exact wicked penalties.
577. "Doubtless will she, unhurt, look upon Sparta and the Mycenaean
578. fatherlands, and go [forth] as queen with victory obtained?
579. Will she see [her] husband, and the home of [her] father,
580. and [her] sons, attended by a crowd of Trojans and Phrygians?
581. Will Priam have died by iron [sword]? Will Troy have blazed with fire?
582. Will the shore have sweat so often with the blood of Trojans?
583. Not so. For, even if no glorious name is in
584. the feminine punishment, this victory has merit;
585. Nevertheless, I will be praised to have extinguished the crime
586. and to have exacted the deserving punishments, and it will please
587. [my] soul to have fulfilled the flame of vengeance and to have satisfied the ashes of my men."
588. I tossed about such things and was carried by frenzied mind,}
589. When to me the nurturing parent presented herself to be seen,
590. never before so clear for the eyes, and glittered in the pure light
591. through the night, having revealed [herself] a goddess, and in this type
592. and size, she was accustomed to be seen by divinities, and she restrains
593. [my] grasp with right [hand] and besides added these with rosy mouth:
594. "Son, what pain so great excites [these] uncontrolled rages?
595. Why do you fume? Or to where did concern of us recede for you?
596. Will you not see beforehand where you left behind [your] parent
597. Anchises, tired with age, or whether [your] wife Creusa and the
598. boy Ascanius survives? Greek battle lines wander about them all
599. and, unless my care should stop it, now flames will have
600. destroyed [them] and hostile sword will have drained [them].
601. Not the face hated by you of the Spartan daughter of Tyndarus,
602. nor the blamed Paris, [but] the cruelty of the gods overturns
603. these riches of the gods and lays low Troy from [its] summit.
604. Behold (for now I will snatch away the entire cloud, which now, having been
605. drawn over, weakens mortal vision for you looking, and,
606. damp, darkens [everything] around; You, do not fear any orders
607. of [your] parent, nor refuse to obey [my] instructions):
608. here, where you see the scattered mountains and the boulders
609. torn from boulders, and the waving smoke, with dust stirred up,
610. Neptune shatters the walls and the foundations, moved by
611. [his] great trident, and overthrows the whole city from [its] seats.
612. Here the fiercest Juno first holds the Scaean gates
613. and, fuming and equipped with iron [sword], calls the
614. [^614] allied column from the ships.
615. Now, behold, Minerva, gleaming in a cloud and
616. with the fierce Gorgon, occupies the highest citadels.
617. The father himself (Jupiter) supplies favorable spirits and strengths,
618. he himself arouses the gods against Trojan arms.
619. Take up flight, son, and put an end to [your] labor;
620. never will I be absent, and I will stand you safely on the paternal threshold."

# Aeneid Book 4 (Mar 2023)
160. Meanwhile with a great roar, the sky begins to be mixed,
161. and a raincloud follows with hailstones mingled,
162. and the Tyrian comrades everywhere, and the Trojan youth,
163. and the Dardanian grandson of Venus seek different
164. coverings through the fields with fearing; rivers rush from the mountains.
165. Dido and the Trojan leader arrive down at the same cave.
166. Both primal Earth and Iuno, matron of honor, give a signal;
167. Fires and the upper air, privy to the marriages, shined,
168. and from the highest summit, the Nymphs howled.
169. That day was the occasion, first of death and first of evils;
170. And thus Dido was neither moved by [her?] appearance or reputation,
171. and nor [did she] design the love [to be] secret:
172. she calls [it] marriage, [and] with this name she cloaks blame.
173. Immediately, Rumor goes through the great cities of Libya,
174. Rumor, an evil than which not any other [is] speedier:
175. she thrives with activity and acquires forces by going,
176. small on account of fearing first, soon she lifts herself into the breezes
177. and enters on soil and establishes [her] head between the clouds.
178. Mother earth birthed her with anger against the gods provoked,
179. the last, as they say, sister to Coeus and Enceladus,
180. quick with feet and with nimble wings, a terrible monster,
181. giant, for whom there were so many feathers on [her] body,
182. as [there were] vigilant eyes under [the feathers] (marvelous to say),
183. as many tongues, and just as many mouths resound, as many ears she raises.
184. By night she flies, whirring, in the middle of the sky and earth
185. through the darkness, and nor does she droop [her] eyes for sweet sleep;
186. By day she sits as guards or on the roof of the highest house
187. or on tall towers, and she frightens the great cities,
188. holding as many of fiction and evil as a messenger of truth.
189. Then she, rejoicing, filled the peoples with conversation manifold,
190. and she sang equally facts and fictions:
191. that Aeneas sprung from Trojan blood has come,
192. with which husband Dido deemed herself worthy to join [in marriage];
193. that now throughout the winter they cherished between themselves in luxury
194. as long [as the winter was], seized by shameful desire and neglectful of [their] kingdoms.
195. The loathsome goddess scatters these [words] all about in the mouths of men.
196. Immediately she turns [her] path towards king Iarbas
197. and inflames [his] spirit with words and heaps up angers.
198. He, begot from Hammon with the raped Garamantine nymph,
199. placed a hundred immense temples to Jove in [his] wide kingdoms
200. and a hundred altars, and he had dedicated a watchful fire,
201. eternal sentinels of the gods, a soil fertile in the blood
202. of flock animals, and thresholds blooming with various garlands.
203. And he, frenzied of mind and inflamed by the bitter rumor,
204. before the altars of the gods [and] among the middle of the divine wills,
205. is said to have begged, suppliant, many [things from] Jupiter, with hands upturned:
206. "O omnipotent Jupiter, for whom the Moorish clan,
207. having dined upon painted couches, now pours the Bacchic honor,
208. do you see these things? Or do we vainly shudder at you,
209. O father, when you hurl thunderbolts, and [when] dark fires
210. in clouds terrify spirits and mix up useless murmurs?
211. A woman, who, wandering among our [men] placed in [our] borders
212. a scanty city for a price, to whom [we gave] a shore to be plowed,
213. and for whom we gave the laws of the land, rejected
214. our marriages and received Lord Aeneas into [her] kingdoms.
215. And now that Paris with an effeminate company, having tied
216. a Lydian cap around [his] chin and hair, dripping [with perfume],[^4.216]
217. possess the booty: Surely we carry gifts to your temples
218. and ~~fondle~~ cherish [your] useless fame."

[^4.216]: subnexus = Greek middle participle, not a literal translation

<hr/>

259. When [Mercury] first touched the huts with [his] winged heels,
260. he saw Aeneas establishing citadels and renewing roofs.
261. And his sword was star-spangled with yellow jasper,
262. and [his] cloak, lowered from [his] shoulders,
263. blazed with Tyrian purple, gifts which rich Dido had made,
264. and [she] had seperated the textiles with fine gold.
265. Immediately [Mercury] addresses [him]\: "Do you now place
266. the foundations of tall Carthage and, wife-ruled, build up a beautiful city?
267. Alas, O [you] having forgotten of the kingdom and your affairs!
268. The ruler of the gods himself, who sways heaven and the earths with [his] will,
269. sent me down from illustrious Olympus to you, he himself
270. orders [me] to bring these commands through the swift breezes:
271. What do you build? Or with what hope do you waste idleness in Libyan lands?
272. If no glory of such great things moves you
273. (and moreover, nor do you yourself undertake labor due to your praise)[^4.273]
274. look back at growing Ascanius and the hopes of [your] heir Julus,
275. to whom the kingdom of Italy and the Roman lands are owed."
276. Cyllenean [Mercury], having spoken with such a mouth,
277. left from mortal visions in the middle of [his] speech,
278. and at a distance, he vanished from eyes into thin air.
279. But truly Aeneas, frenzied because of the sight, stood speechless,
280. and hairs were erected by the horror, and [his] voice clung to the throats.
281. He burns to depart in flight and to abandon the sweet lands,
282. astounded by such a great warning and the command of the gods.
283. Alas what should he do? With what speech should he now dare to
284. conciliate the raging queen? What first beginnings should he take?
285. And yet he divides [his] swift spirit now here then there,
286. and snatches [his spirit] into various parts, and he turns through all.
287. This resolve seemed to the wavering one [to be] preferable:
288. He should call Mnetheus and Sergestus and brave Serestus, and,
289. silent, they should equip the ship and muster [their] comrades to the shores,
290. they should prepare arms and conceal what cause [there is] for renewing things;
291. Meanwhile, [Aeneas], since the finest Dido
292. should be ignorant and not hope that such great love be burst,
293. [thinks] that he himself will seek the approaches and what times of speaking
294. [should be] easiest, what mode [would be] right for the things.
295. Rather swiftly, gladly all obey the command and fulfill the orders.
296. But the queen (who should be able to fool the loving one?)
297. suspects the deceits, and catches the movement about to happen,
298. fearing first [even if] all [was] safe. That same wicked Rumor
299. reports to the fuming [Dido] that the ship is armed and the course is prepared.
300. She rages, bereft of mind, and, having been inflamed, rages
301. through the whole city, excited by sacred agitations like a Bacchant,
302. when, with "Bacchus" heard, they incite the triennial orgies
303. and nocturnal Cithaeron calls [out] with a clamor.
304. Finally she addresses Aeneas voluntarily with these voices:
305. "Did you even hope, O perfidious one, that [you] could conceal
306. such a great crime, and, silent, depart from my land?
307. Do not our love, not the right hand formerly given,
308. nor Dido about to die with a cruel funeral hold you?
309. In fact, you even hasten to prepare a fleet under wintery star
310. and to go through the deep [ocean] in the middle of the north wind,
311. O cruel one? Why, if you should not seek alien fields and
312. unknown homes, and ancient Troy should remain,
313. should Troy be sought by [your] fleets through the wavy sea?
314. Do you flee from me? I beg you, through these tears and your right [hand]
315. (since I myself have now left not anything at all to miserable me),
316. through our marriages, through the wedding hymns begun,
317. if I deserve anything good from you, or [if] anything of mine was sweet
318. to you: take pity on the falling house, and,
319. if there is any place to this point for prayers, discard that mentality.
320. Because of you, the Libyan clans and the tyrants of the Nomades
321. hate [me], the Tyrians [are] hostile; because of that same you
322. [my] honor and the former fame by which alone I was approaching
323. the stars [is] extinguished. For whom do you desert me, about to die,
324. O stranger (because this name alone remains from [our] marriage)?
325. Why do I delay? Until either [my] brother Pygmalion destroys
326. my walls or African Iarbas leads [me] captive?
327. At least if some child had been begotten for me from you
328. before [your] flight, if some tiny Aeneas played in the palace
329. for me-- [a child] who would recall you with [his] face,
330. surely I would not seem utterly deserted and seized."
331. She had said [this]. He held [his] eyes unmoved because of Jupiter's warnings
332. and, having struggled, he pressed care under [his] heart.
333. Finally he replies [in] few [words]\: "O Queen, I will never deny that you
334. deserve the most things which you can enumerate by speaking,
335. nor will it pain me to have remembered Elissa (Dido)
336. while I myself remember myself, while breath rules these limbs.
337. For [this] thing I will speak few [words]. Neither did I hope
338. to hide this flight with trickery (don't imagine it!), nor did I
339. ever extend the torches of marriage or come into these agreements.
340. If the fates were to allow me to lead [my] life under my [own] auspices
341. and to settle my cares under my [own] will,
342. first I would cherish the city Troy and the sweet remnants
343. of my [men], the high roofs of Priam would remain, and I would have placed
344. renewed citadels (Pergama) by hand for the conquered [Trojans].
345. But now Grynian Apollo [orders me to] great Italy,
346. and the oracles of Lycia order me to seize Italy;
347. This is love, this is [my] homeland. If the citadels of the Carthage
348. and the sight of the Libyan city hold you, a Phoenician,
349. what grudge is there that [we] Teucrians finally settle in Italian land?
350. And also it is divine law that we seek foreign kingdoms.
351. The troubled ghost of [my] father Anchises, as often as night covers
352. the lands with damp shadows, as often as stars grow fiery,
353. warns and terrifies me in [my] sleeps;
354. [My] boy Ascanius and the injustices of [that] dear head,
355. whom I cheat of the kingdom and fated fields of Italy, [move] me.
356. Even now an agent of the gods, sent by Jove himself
357. (I swear by both [of our] heads), carried down the mandates
358. through swift breezes: I myself saw the god in clear light
359. entering the walls, and I drank in [his] voice with these ears.
360. Cease inflaming both me and you with your laments;
361. I do not seek Italy by [my own] will."

<hr/>

659. She spoke, and having pressed [her] face in the couch, "We will die
660. unavenged, but let us die," she says, "Thus, [and] thus, let it help [me] go
661. under the shadows. Let the Dardanian [Aeneas] drink in this fire with [his] cruel eyes
662. from the sea, and let him bear with him all [things] of our death."
663. She had spoke, and [her] comrades saw her, having fainted because of a sword
664. among the middles of such [words] (?), and [they saw] the blade foaming
665. with blood and [her] hands sprinkled [with blood]. A clamor goes
666. towards the high courts: Rumor raves through the shattered city.
667. The roofs roar with the lamentations and groans and wails of women,
668. the sky resounds with great wailings, not different than
669. if entire Carthage should fall to enemies sent in
670. or ancient Tyre, and raging flames should be rolled
671. both through the roofs of men and through [those] of the gods [i.e. temples].
672. [Anna], breathless, heard [this], and terrified by the excited course [of things],[^4.672]
673. the sister, defiling [her] faces with nails and her breast with fists,
674. rushed through the centers, and calls the dying one by name:
675. "Was this that [which you planned], sister? Did you seek me with a deceit?
676. For me did that pyre [prepare] this, did the fires and altars prepare this?[^4.676]
677. What first should I, deserted, bewail? Did you all, dying, spurn
678. [your] companion and sister? Were you to call me to the same fates:
679. the same pain and the same hour would have brought both [of us] to the blade.
680. I even built [this] with these hands, and I called the paternal gods
681. [with my] voices, so that with you placed thus, O cruel one, I would be absent?
682. You all have destroyed yourself and me, sister, and the people and the Sidonian
683. fathers and your city.-- Give [it to me], I will wash the wounds with waters
684. and, if moreover any final breath was [left], I will catch [it] with [my] mouth."
685. Having spoken thus, she had passed over the tall steps, and having embraced
686. [her] half-dead sister in [her] bosom, she cherished [her]
687. with a groan and dried the black bloods with [her] clothing.
688. She tried to lift [her] heavy eyes again [but] fails;
689. the wound pierced below [her] breast gurgled.
690. Thrice lifting herself up and leaning on [her] elbow she raised [herself],
691. she was rolled over thrice on the couch and with eyes wandering from tall heaven
692. she sought the light, and with [it] found, she groaned.[^4.692]
693. <span class="ml-2">&nbsp;</span>Then omnipotent Juno, having pitied the long pain
694. and difficult deaths, sent from Olympus Iris,
695. who was to free the struggling spirit and bound limbs.
696. For because she perished neither because of merited fate nor death,
697. but, miserable, before [her] day and suddenly, because of inflamed passion,
698. not yet had Proserpine stolen for her the yellow hair from [her] head
699. and doomed [her] head to Stygian Pluto.
700. Thus dewy Iris with saffron feathers flew down through heaven,
701. dragging a thousand varied colors because of the opposite sun,
702. and stood above [her] head. "I, having been ordered,
703. bring this sacred [hair] to Pluto and free you from that body.":
704. Thus she said [this] and with [her] right [hand] she cuts the hair,
705. and all warmth departs at once and life withdraws into the winds.

[4.672]: Is this really the correct translation? why is the -que placed there & what words go where?
[4.676]: Don't think this part is right either?
[4.692]: I think Hull did this line wrong in class and "quaesivit... lucem ingemuitque reperta" is correct

# Aeneid Book 6 (May 2023)
295. Here [is] the path which brings [travelers] to the waves of Tartarian Acheron.
296. Here the turbid abyss boils with mud and a vast whirlpool,
297. and it vomits all the sand upon Cocytus.
298. The horrendous ferryman Charon guards over these waters and rivers
299. with dreadful filth, for whom many an unkempt grey hair
300. lies on [his] chin, [his] eyes stand with flame, [and]
301. a dirty cloak hangs down from [his] shoulders in a knot.
302. He himself pushes the raft with a pole, and he tends to the sails
303. and transports the bodies with [his] rusty skiff,
304. now an old man, but old age [is] fresh and green for a god.
305. To here the whole crowd, having been poured out, was rushing to the shores,
306. mothers and men and bodies finished with life
307. of great-souled heroes, boys and unmarried girls,
308. young men placed upon funeral pyres before the faces of parents:
309. As many leaves, having slipped off, fall in the forests of autumn
310. at the first frost, or as many birds gather towards the land
311. from the deep whirlpool, when the frigid year flees
312. across the sea and lets in the sunny lands.
313. The first ones were standing, begging [him] to send [them]
314. [across] the course, and they were stretching [their] hands with love of the further shore.
315. But the sad sailer receives now these [then] now those,
316. but keeps others, having been removed, far from the beach.
317. Aeneas, marveling [at this] indeed, and moved by the clamor,
318. "Speak," he says, "O maiden, what does the crowd wish for at [this] shore?
319. Or what do the spirits seek? Or because of what distinction do they
320. leave the shores, those sweep over the dark shallows with oars?"
321. Thus, the aged priestess spoke briefly to that one:
322. "O, one born from Anchises, the most certain descendent of the gods,
323. you see the deep waters of Cocytis and the Stygian marsh,
324. the divine power for which the gods fear to swear and to deceive.
325. This whole crowd, which you discern, is destitute and unburied.
326. that ferryman [is] Charon; those, whom the water carries, are buried.
327. And nor is it given to transport [them] across the horrible shores
328. and roaring streams before [their] bones quiet in [their] seats.
329. They wander for a hundred years and fly around these shores;
330. then, finally having been admitted, they revisit the wished-for waters."
331. The one born from Anchises stopped and represses [his] footsteps,
332. considering many things, pitying the unfair destiny in [his] mind.

<hr/>

384. Thus they finish the journey begun and they approach towards the stream.
385. The ferryman, as he now then caught sight from the Stygian wave
386. those who go through the silent grove and turn [their] feet towards the shore,
387. thus the former addresses [them] with words and chides them further:
388. "Whoever you are, armed ones who strive towards our rivers,
389. speak, do it, why you should come, now stop your step there.
390. This is a place of shadows, of sleep and of sleepy knight:
391. it is a crime to cary living bodies with [my] boat.
392. Nor in truth am I happy to have received Hercules
393. going to the lake, nor Theseus and Pirithous,
394. although they were born from gods and unconquered in strengths.
395. The former sought Tartarus's guard into chains with [his] hand
396. and dragged [him] trembling from throne of the king himself;
397. the latter attempted to abduct the mistress of Pluto from [her] bedroom."
398. And the prophet Amphrysia briefly said which things in response:
399. "Here there are no such great ambushes (stop being moved),
400. nor do [these] weapons bring violence; it is permitted [that] the great doorkeeper
401. in [his] cave, barking forever, terrify the pale shadows,
402. it is permitted that pure Proserpine watch over the threshold of [her] uncle.
403. Trojan Aeneas, distinguished in piety and in arms,
404. descends to the lowest shadows of Hades towards [his] father.
405. If no ghost of such great piety moves you,
406. but recognize this branch." (she reveals the branch which lied in [her] robe)
407. The hearts, swelling from anger, then settle down;
408. nor [does she say] more [things] than these. The former, admiring
409. the venerable gift of the fatal twig, seen after a long time,
410. turns to the dark-blue stern and approaches the shore.
411. Then he drives off the other spirits, which sat along the long benches,
412. and loosens the deck; likewise he receives great Aeneas
413. with the boat. The sewn skiff groaned under the weight
414. and, leaky, takes on much [of the] swamp.
415. Finally, across the stream it places both the man and the prophet,
416. unharmed, in shapeless sludge and gray marsh.
417.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giant Cerberus sounds these kingdoms with
418. a three-throated bark, reclining, huge, in the opposite cave.
419. And seeing that whose neck now shuddered with snakes, the prophet
420. presents a cake made drowsy with honey and with drugged fruits.
421. He, opening [his] three throats with frenzied hunger, snatches up
422. the presented [cake], and having been poured to the ground,
423. he loosens [his] immense spines, and giant, stretches out in the whole cave.
424. With the guardian buried, Aeneas seizes the entrance,
425. and swift, passes over the shore of the irretraceable wave.

450. And among whom Phoenician Dido, fresh from a wound,
451. was wandering in a great forest; and whom the Trojan hero,
452. as [he] first stood near [her], recognized [her], dark, through the shadows,
453. just as one who either sees or thinks that [he] sees during the first month
454. that the moon rises through the clouds,
455. he sends down tears and addresses [her] with sweet love:
456. "Unhappy Dido, had a true message come to me then,
457. that [you] were destroyed, and that [you] sought deaths by iron [sword]?
458. Alas, was I the cause of death for you? By the stars I swear,
459. by the higher [gods] and if there is some honor under the deepest earth,
460. queen, I departed from your shore unwilling.
461. But the orders of the gods, which now [command me] to go through these shadows,
462. force me through locations thorny with neglect and deep night,
463. they forced me with their own commands; nor was I able to believe
464. that I brought this such great pain to you by [my] departure.
465. Stop [your] footstep and do not withdraw yourself from our sight.
466. What do you flee? Because of fate, this is the final [word] which I address you."
467. With such words Aeneas soothes the burning spirit
468. having watched on grimly, and he stirred up [her] tears.
469. She, having been turned away, was holding [her] eyes fixed on the ground,
470. and she was not moved with respect to [her] face[^470] by the speech undertaken
471. more than if a hardy ruck or Marpesian cliff should stand.
472. Finally she snatched herself up and, hostile, flees
473. into the shady grove, where [her] former husband Sychaeus
474. answers to her with cares and matches [her] love.
475. And Aeneas, not less shaken by the unfair misfortune,
476. follows far off with tears and pities the one going.

847. "Others will hammer out breathing bronzes more gracefully
848. (indeed I trust it), they will lead living faces from marble,
849. they will plead [their] cases better, and they will describe the motion
850. of heaven with a rod, and they will speak of rising stars:
851. O you Roman, remember to rule nations with authority
852. (these will be your skills), and to impose law during peace,
853. to spare the conquered and crush the haughty."
854. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus father Anchises [spoke], and he adds these [words]
855. for the admiring ones: "Behold, Marcellus enters, distinguished
856. with the greatest prizes, and the conquerer towers above all men.
857. This cavalryman will support the Roman state with great shaking uproar,
858. he will lay low the Phoenicians and the Gallic rebellion,
859. and he will hang up the third arms seized for father Quirinus."
860. And here Aeneas (and for he saw that together [with Marcellus] a youth went,
861. distinguished in beauty and in glittering arms, but [his] brow
862. was too little happy and [his] eyes were with dejected countenance)
863. "Father, who is that, who accompanies the walking man thus?
864. A son, or another [one] from [his] great lineage of descendants?
865. What uproar of the comrades is about! How great a weight in him!
866. But a black night flies about [his] head with a sad shadow."
867. Then father Anchises, having begun, [said] with tears arising:
868. "O child, do not seek the great sorrow of your [men];
869. the fates will only show him to the lands, and they will not
870. allow [him] to be longer. O gods, the Roman offspring
871. seemed too powerful to y'all, if this special gift had been [lasting].
872. What such great groans of men will that field of Mars drive to the great city!
873. the great city of men! And which funerals indeed you will see, Tiberinus,
874. when you will glide through the recent tomb!
875. Neither will any boy from the Trojan clan raise
876. the Latin ancestors so much with hope, nor will Roman land
877. flaunt itself so much with any child.
878. Alas devotion, alas ancient faith, and right [hand] unconquered
879. in war! Not anyone had carried themselves unpunished
880. meeting him armed, whether when he went [as] infantry against the enemy
881. or he pierced flanks with the spurs of [his] foaming horse.
882. Alas, O boy to be pitied, if you may destroy the harsh fates with anything--
883. you will be a Marcellus. Give lilies with full hands,
884. let me scatter crimson flowers and at least honor the spirit
885. of the descendant with these gifts, and let me fulfill a useless
886. duty." Thus they wander everywhere in the whole region
887. in wide fields of air, and they survey everything.
888. And after which things, Anchises led [his] son through one by one
889. and kindled [his] spirit with love of coming fame,
890. next he recounts to the man the wars which then [are] to be fought,
891. and he teaches about the Laurentian people and the city of Latinus,
892. and in what way he would both flee and bear each labor.
893. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are twin gates of Sleep, one of which is said
894. to be of horn, through which an easy exit is given to true shades,
895. the other made shining with gleaming ivory,
896. but the shades send false dreams to the sky [through this gate].
897. There, with these words, Anchises then escorts together [his] son
898. and Sibyl, and he sends [them] forth through the ivory gate;
899. The former cuts a path towards [his] ships and sees again [his] comrades.

# Caesar book 1 & 6 (Oct 2022)
1.1 All Gaul is divided into three parts, of which the Belgae inhabit one, the Aquitani another, and [those] who are called Celts in their language, Gauls in ours [inhabit] a third. These [tribes] differ among themselves in language, institutions, and laws. The Garumna river separates the Gauls from the Aquitani, the Matrona and Sequana [separate them] from the Belgae. Of all these, the bravest are the Belgae, because they are the longest absent from the culture and refinement of the province, and merchants last often visit to them and bring in the things which pertain to effeminating minds, and they are nearest to the Germans, who live across the Rhine, with whom they continually wage war. Because of which reason, the Helvetians also surpass the remaining Gauls in virtue, because they fight with the Germans in almost-daily battles, when they either keep them from their own borders or themselves wage war in their borders. One part of these [territories], which it was said that the Gauls obtained, takes [its] beginning from the Rhone river, is contained by the Garumna river, by the ocean, by the borders of the Belgae, [a part] even reaches the Rhine river from the Sequani and the Helvetians and lies towards the north. The Belgae arise from the outermost boundaries of Gaul, they reach to the lower part of the Rhine river, they look into the North and the rising (Eastern) sun. The Aquitania reaches from the Garumna river to the Pyreneian mountains and that part of the Ocean which is towards Spain; [the Aquitani] watch between the setting (Western) sun and the North.

1.2 Among the Helvetians, by far the most noble and most wealthy was Orgetorix. He, with Marco Messala and Marcus Pupius Piso as consuls, influenced by the desire of (tyrannical) kingship, made a conspiracy of the nobility and persuaded the city that they should leave from their own borders with all [their] resources: [he said] that to control all Gaul with authority would be very easy, because they surpassed all with respect to virtue. Because of this, he rather easily persuaded them of this,[^1.2.7] because the Helvetians are contained on all sides by the nature of the place: [it was that] from one side, [they are contained] by the widest and deepest Rhine river, which divides Helvetian territory from the Germans; from the another side, by the tallest mount Jura, which is between the Sequanni and the Helvetians; [from] a third [side, they are contained] by Lake Lemannus (Lake Leman, Geneva) and the Rhode river, which separates our province from the Helvetians. On account of these things, it became that[^1.2.13] they roamed less widely and were less easily able to wage war in [their] neighboring [borders]; and from which part the men eager of waging war were afflicted with great pain. But for the a multitude of people and for the glory of war and courage, they considered that they had narrow borders, which in length lie open for 240 thousands of paces[^1.2.18], in breadth 180.

[^1.2.7]: Persuasit: To persuade (someone +dat) of (something +acc)
[^1.2.13]: Substantive result clause: Acting as subject of "fiebat"
[^1.2.18]: Milia = Accusative of extent of space

1.3 On account of these things, those influenced and moved by the authority of Orgetorix resolved to prepare those things which pertained to setting out, to buy as great a number of pack animals and carts [as possible], to make sowings as great [as possible] so that in the journey an abundance of grain would be supplied, and to declare peace and friendship with the closest cities. For finishing these things, they considered[^1.3.7] that two years would be enough for themselves; in the third year they establish a departure by law. For finishing these things Orgetorix is selected. He undertook upon himself the embassy to the cities. On that journey he persuades Casticus, the son of Catamanteloedis, a Sequani whose father had held rule in the Sequani for many years and had been called by the senate friend of the Roman people, that he should take control of ruling power in his city, which [his] father had held before; And likewise, he persuades Aeduan Dumnorix, the brother of Diviciacus, who (Diviciacus) at that time held leadership in the city and was greatly pleasing to the populace, that [he should] try the same, and he gives his own daughter to him in marriage. He demonstrates that to complete the attempted [feats] would be very easy to do, because he himself was about to obtain ruling power of his own city: [he said] that there was no doubt that the Helvetians would be exceedingly able [to control] all Gaul; he declares that he will secure the ruling powers for them with his own resources and his own army. Those influenced by this speech pledge loyalty and an oath to be sworn among themselves, and they hope that with the ruling power seized through three very fierce and strong peoples, they would be able to master all Gaul.

1.4 This plot was disclosed to the Helvetians through the evidence (of an informant). According to their own customs[^1.4.1], they force Orgetorix to state [his] case from chains. It behooved punishment to follow the condemned, so that he would be burned by fire. On the day of the pleading of the case agreed to, Orgetorix compelled on all sides his whole own family to the trial, towards ten thousand people, and to the same [place], he assembled all his own clients and debtors, a great number of which he had; through them he rescued himself so that he would not plead [his] case. When the city, incensed by this incident, tried to enforce its own law with arms, and the magistrates compelled a crowd of men from the fields, Orgetorix died; and nor is suspicion absent, as the Helvetians judge it, that he himself contrived death for himself.

[^1.4.1]: Ablative of accordance (respect or specification)

1.5 After his death, the Helvetians no less resolved to do that which they are trying, that they should leave from their own borders. As soon as (lit. When now) they judged that they were ready for this undertaking, they burn all their own towns, towards twelve in number, towards four-hundred villages, and the remaining private buildings; they burn all the grain, except for what they will carry with them, so that with hope of returning home destroyed, they would be more prepared for enduring all dangers; they order each one to bring from home ground flour of three months for themselves[^1.5.7]. They persuade the neighboring Rauraci and Tulingi and Latobrigi, that using the same idea, they set out together with them with their own towns and villages burnt up, and they receive as allies recovered for themselves the Boios, who had lived across the Rhine and had crossed into the Noreian field and fought the Noricians.

[^1.5.7]: Genitive of measure of time???

1.6 There were only two paths, by which paths they were able to leave from [their] home:  one through the Sequanni, narrow and difficult, between the Iura mountain and the Rhine river, where[^1.6.3] single carts could hardly be led, but the tallest montain was overhanging, so that a few people were able to block [it] easily; the other [path] through our province [was] easier by much and unimpeded, because between the borders of the Helvetians and Allobroges, who recently had been pacified, the Rhine flows, and it could be crossed in some places by a ford. Geneva, the farthest town of the Allobroges, is nearest to the borders of the Helvetians. From that town a bridge extends to the Helvetians. They were considering that they themselves will either persuade the Allobroges, because they did not yet seem [to be] with good spirit in the Roman people, or compel them by force that they allow them to go through their own borders. They say the day with all things prepared for setting out, on which day they would all gather at the bank of the Rhone. That day was (ante diem V. Kalends April, 5 days before the Kalends of April) with Lucius Piso and Aulus Gabinius as consuls.

[^1.6.3]: quā = adverbial where; qua via = by which path

1.7 When this had been reported to Caesar, that they were trying to make a journey through our province, he hastens to set out from the city and with journeys as great he can, he hastens into remote Gaul and arrives at Geneva. He orders from the whole province as great a number of soldiers as he can (there was in remote Gaul only one legion), he orders the bridge, which was at Geneva, to be destroyed. When the Helvetians were made more certain about his arrival, they send the noblest ambassadors to him, of which embassy Nammeius and Verucloetius held the principal place, who were to say that it was in mind for them to make a journey through the province without any mischief, because they had no other journey: they ask that it be allowed for them to do this [journey] with his consent. Caesar, because he held in [his] memory that consul Lucius Cassius was killed and his army was defeated by the Helvetians and sent under a yoke, did not think that this was to be permitted; and he did not consider that the people with hostile spirit, with the opportunity of making a journey through the province given, would refrain from damage and mischief. However, so that an interval [of time] would be able to pass until the soldiers whom he had ordered could arrive, he responds to the ambassadors that he would take a day for deliberating: if they should want anything, they should return on the ides of April.

6.13 In all Gaul, there are two class of those men who are with some number and number. For the plebacy is held nearly in the place of slaves, who dares nothing though themselves, and is employed in no council. And the masses, when they are oppressed either by alien bronze (debt), or by the size of a tributes(/taxes), or by the injustice of the rather powerful [men], will surrender themselves into servitude to the nobles, for whom there are all the same powers (over) them, which [there are] for masters (over) slaves. But concerning these two classes, one is of the Druids, the other is of the equites. They are present for divine things [and] care for public and private sacrifices, [and] they interpret superstitions: a great number of young men rush to them for the purpose of learning, and they are among them (the young men) in great distinction. For they decide concerning nearly all public and private controversies, and, if some crime was committed, if murders were made, if there is controversy concerning inheritance, concerning borders, they decree the same [and] decide rewards and punishments; if somebody, either private or populous, did not abide by their decree, they exclude [them] from sacrifices. This punishment among them is most severe. Those, for whom it was interdicted thusly, were held in a number of criminals and impieties, all depart from them and flee from [their] approach and conversation, lest they receive something of inconvenience from the touch, and for those seeking justice, it is neither returned, nor is any distinction shared. Yet one is at the head of all these Druids, [one] who has among them the greatest authority. With him dead, either if somebody surpassed from the rest in dignity, he succeeds, or, if there are many equals, with the voting of the Druids, sometimes even with arms they contend for the principal [spot]. At a certain time of year, they settle in a place in the borders of the Carnutes, a region which was held [to be] the center of all Gaul. Here all who have controversies from everywhere convene [and] abide by the decrees and judgements of them (Druids). [This] discipline is thought to have been discovered in Britain and then brought into Gaul, and now, [all] who wish to understand that thing more carefully set out  for that [place] very often for the purpose of learning.

6.14 The Druids became accustomed to being absent from war, and they do not pay tributes together with the remaining [men]; they have immunity of all things and exemption of military service. Excited by these prizes, many both convene into [this] discipline by their own will and are sent by parents and relatives. There, they are said to memorize a great number of verses. Thus, some remain in the study for twenty years. And nor do they think that it is right to commit those [things] to letters, although in almost [all] the remaining things, in public and private accounts, they use Greek letters. To me, they seem to have instituted this because of two causes, because they neither wish that the discipline be known into the common population, nor [did they wish] that those, who learn, trusting[^6.14.11] in letters, to strive for memory less: because it nearly happened to many, that because of the protection of letters, they give up memory and diligence in learning. In the first [times], they wish to persuade this: that souls do not perish, but cross from some to others after death, and because of this they consider [people] to be most greatly driven to virtue with fear of death neglected. Furthermore, they debate many [things] about stars and their motion, about the size of the world and earth, about the nature of things, about the strength and power of immortal gods, and they teach [it] to the youth.

[^6.14.11]: Semideponent verb: Use passive forms in perfect tenses with active meaning.

6.15 The other class is of horsemen (equites). They, when it is useful and some war arises (which, before the arrival of Caesar, was accustomed to happen nearly every year that they themselves may inflict injuries, or drive off those inflicted), all are turned in war; and as each of them is most prominent in family and resources, so thus [each] has around himself more vassals and clients. They know this one influence and power.

6.16 The whole nation of Gauls was completely devoted to religions, and because of that reason, those who were afflicted with rather serious illnesses and those who are turned in the dangers and battles either sacrifice humans as victims or vow that they will sacrifice [someone], and they use Druid priests at those sacrifices, because, unless [another] life of a person should be given back for the life of a person, they judge that the will of the immortal gods is not able to be appeased, and they have sacrifices instituted publicly of the same kind. Others have statues of immense magnitude, the limbs of which, bound with wickers, they fill with living humans; with which burnt, the men, surrounded by flame, are killed[^6.16.10]. They judge the punishments of those who were arrested in theft or in robbery or another crime to be more gratifying for the immortal gods; but, when the supply of that kind is deficient, they even resort to the punishments of the innocents.

[^6.16.10]: lit: Are deprived of living breath

6.17 Of the gods they worship Mercury the most. There are many statues of him: they judge that he [is] the inventor of all arts, that he [is] the commander of roads and journeys, that he has the greatest force for the enterprises and acquisitions of money. After him [they worship] Apollo and Mars and Jove and Minerva. About them they have the same opinion as the nearly [all] the remaining peoples: that Apollo wards off sicknesses, that Minerva gives the beginnings of works and artifices, that Jove holds power of celestial beings, that Mars controls wars. To him, when they resolved to fight in battle, they often devote those [things] which they will have captured in war: when they conquered, they collect the remaining things in one place. In many cities it is allowed to see mounds built of these things in consecrated places; and not often does it occur, that anyone, with religion disregarded, dares to either hide the captured among themselves or to steal the placed [things], for this thing the most serious punishment with torture was decreed.

6.18 The Gauls proclaim that they all were descended from father Pluto and they say that it was handed down by the Druids. On account of that reason, they determine the space of all time not by the number of days but of nights; thus they observe birthdays and the starts of months and years so that the day follows the night. In the other institutions of life, they differ from the nearly [all the] rest in this respect, which [is that] they do not allow their own children, unless when they have grown up, so that they might be able to endure the duty of the military, to approach towards themselves openly, and they consider shameful that a son with childish age stands in public in the sight of the father.

6.19 Men accept as much money from wives in the name of dowry as they share from their own goods, with the appraisal made, with dowries. An account of all this money is held jointly and the rewards are saved: whichever of them prevails in life, to them part of the other's [account] with profits of previous times arrives. The men have in wives, just as in children, the power of life and death; and when the paterfamilias born from a rather distinguished location dies, his relatives convene and, if the thing about the death comes into suspicion, they have questioning about the wives in a slavish way and if it was ascertained, they kill them, tormented by fire and all tortures. Funerals are, according to the custom of the Gauls, magnificent and expensive; and all whom they judged to have been dear to the living [master][^6.19.13], they carry into fire, even animals, and slightly above (before) this memory (period) slaves and clients, whom it is evident to be chosen by them, with the rightful funerals finished, together were cremated.

[^6.9.13]: Double dative: Literally "For the heart for the living"

6.20 Cities, which they judged to manage their own republic rather easily, have [it] bound by laws, if someone received something about the republic from bordering [states] by hearsay or rumor, that it carries to the magistrate and he does not share [it] with anyone else, because it is known that reckless and ignorant humans are frightened by false rumors and driven to crime and to get ideas about the greatest things. The magistrates hide what was seen and hand down to the crowd what they judged to be from use. Unless through an assembly, it is not permitted to speak about the republic.

# Caesar Book 4 (Jan 2023)
4.24 And the barbarians, with the plan of the Romans known and the horseman and chariots advanced, which type they are accustomed to use very often in battle, following with the remaining troops, they prohibited our [men] to disembark from [our] ships. There was, on account of these causes, the greatest difficulty, because the ships, because of their magnitude, were not able to be anchored, unless in deep [water], but for the soldiers, with locations unknown and hands hindered, oppressed by the great and serious load of arms, together it was to be leapt down from the ships and to be stood in the rivers and to be fought with enemies, when they [the enemies], having advanced either from dry [land] or slightly into water with all limbs unimpeded, with the locations most familiar, boldly hurled weapons and urged on trained horses. For which reasons, our [men], terrified and completely inexperienced of this kind of fight, were not using the same eagerness and devotion, which they were accustomed to use in battles on foot.

4.25 And when Caesar noticed this, he ordered the long ships, the sight of which was both rather startling for the barbarians and the motion lighter-armed to use, to be withdrawn slightly from the loaded ships and to be urged on by oars, and to be driven towards the open flank of the enemies, and then [he ordered] the enemies to be driven back and driven away with slings, arrows, and engines; which decision was a great use for our [men]. For the barbarians, having been incited by both the shape of the ships and the motion of the oars and the unusual type of missiles, stopped and just now slightly retreated [their] foot. And with our soldiers hesitating, especially on account of depth of the sea, he who was carrying the eagle of the tenth legion, having beseeched the gods that this affair may turn out happily for the legion, said "Jump down, comrades, unless you wish to betray [this] eagle to the enemies; I certainly will have supplied my duty to the republic and to [our] commander." When he had said this with a great voice, he threw himself forward out of the ship and began to carry the eagle into the enemies. Then our men, having cheered among themselves, lest such a dishonor be admitted, together leapt down from the ship. Likewise, when the foremen from the nearest ships had seen these, they, having followed closely, approached the enemies.

4.26 It must be fought by both [sides] fiercely. Our men however, because they were neither able to maintain rows, nor stand firmly, nor follow signs, and one man from another ship attached himself with whatsoever standards he had happened upon, they were greatly terrified. The enemies, however, with all shallows known, when from the shore they had caught sight of others departing from the ship one at a time, with horses urged on, they attacked the impeded, the many [enemies] surrounded the few [men], others were throwing weapons into the whole from an open flank. When Caesar had noticed [this], he ordered the skiffs of long ships, and likewise the scouting boats to be filed with soldiers, and to those whom he had saw working hard, he sent reserve forces. Our men, as soon as they stood on dry [land], with all of their own having followed, made an attack against the enemies and gave them into flight; and yet they were not able to pursue too long, because the horsemen were not able to hold the course and take the island. This alone lacked the former fortune for Caesar.

4.27 The enemies having been overpowered in battle, as soon as[^4.27.1] they recovered themselves from the flight, at once they sent legates to Caesar about peace; they promised that they were about to give hostages and about to do whatever [Caesar] had ordered. Together with these legates, came Commius Atrebas, whom I had previously explained was sent ahead by Caesar into Britain. They had arrested him, having disembarked from the ship, although he reported to them with the mandated manner of speaking of Caesar, and they had thrown him into chains; then, with the battle completed, they returned [him], and in reaching for peace they ascribed the blame of this thing into the crowd and they sought that [the crowd] may be pardoned because of [their] imprudence. Caesar, having complained because, although they had voluntarily sought peace from him on the continent with legates sent, they had inflicted war without cause, said [that he] forgave the imprudence, and he ordered the hostages; a part of which they gave at once, and [another] part, having been summoned from rather distant locations, they said that they would give within a few days. Meanwhile, they ordered their own [men] to return into the fields, and the chiefs began to gather everywhere and surrender themselves and their own citizens to Caesar.

4.28 With peace declared with these things, on the fourth day afterwards on which it was gone into Britain, eighteen ships, about which it was discussed above, which had carried the cavalry, sailed from the higher port by gentle wind. And when the Britons approached and were seen from the camps, such a great storm suddenly arose that none of them were able to hold the course, but some were returned to the same [place] from which they had set out, others were cast down with their own great danger to the lower part of the island, which was nearer to the setting of the sun; and when they however, with anchors thrown, were filled with waves, they unavoidably sought the continent, having been carried forth into the deep during the hostile night.

4.29 On that same night, it happened that the moon was full, and which day was accustomed to cause the greatest maritime tides in the ocean, and to our men it was unknown. Thus at one time the tide had filled both the long ships, with which [Caesar] had cared for the army to be transported, and which Caesar had led into dry [land], and the transport ships, which had been fastened to anchors, the tempest injured, and not any power of either managing or helping was being given to our [men]. With many ships broken, because with ropes, anchors, and remaining implements lost, the remaining were useless for sailing, a great disturbance, that which was necessary to occur, was made *by the whole army?*. And for nor were there other ships with which they were able to be carried back, and all was lacking which were for use for repairing ships, and, because it was evident to necessary for all to be wintered in Gaul, the grain was not provided in these locations into winter.

4.30 With which things known, the British chiefs, who had convened towards Caesar after the battle, having discussed among themselves, because they understood that the horses and ships and grain were lacking for the Romans and surmised the paucity of soldiers from the scantiness of the camps, which because of this were more stretched because Caesar had transported the legions without impediments, considered it to be best to do, with rebellion made, to prohibit our [men] from grain and voyage, and to prolong the affair into winter, because with them conquered or precluded from return, they hoped that afterwards, nobody would cross into Britain with the purpose of bringing war. And thus, with conspiracy made again, gradually they began to leave from the camps and secretly conduct their own [men] from the fields.

4.31 But Caesar, even if he had not yet learned their plans, nevertheless both from the outcome of his own ships and from this, [that] because they had neglected to send hostages, was surmising that which happened. And thus, he obtained help for all chances. For he both collected grain from the fields into the camps everyday, and he was using for the repairing of the remaining [ships] the bronze and wood of those which ships had been most gravely injured, and he ordered those things which were for use towards these things to be obtained from the continent. And thus, because it was attended to with the highest devotion by the soldiers, [even] with twelve ships lost, he made it so that it was able to be sailed easily with the remaining [ships].

4.32 While those things were being done, with one legion sent out of custom to forage, which was called the seventh, and without any suspicion of war alleged at that time, while part of the men remained in the fields, part even visited into the camps, those who were in front of the gates of the camps in the outpost announced to Caesar that a greater dust cloud than custom would bring was seen in that part into which the legion made [their] journey. Caesar, having suspected that which was, that something of a new conspiracy was begun by the barbarians, ordered the cohorts which were in the stations to set out with him into that part, [and] from the remaining [he ordered] two cohorts to advance into the station, [and he ordered] the remaining to be armed and immediately closely follow him. When he had advanced slightly farther from the camps, he noticed his own [men] were oppressed by enemies and enduring with sickness, and, with the legion dense, that weapons were thrown from all parts. For because with all grain reaped from remaining parts, one part was left, the enemies, having surmised that our men will come here, hid by night in the forests; then having suddenly attacked [our] scattered [men] occupied in harvesting with weapons put down, with a few killed, they terrified the remaining because of the disordered ranks, [and] at once they surround [our men] with horse and chariots.

4.33 This is the type of fighting from chariots. First, they ride through all parts and hurl weapons and generally terrify ranks with that panic of horses and noise of wheels, and, when  they winded themselves into the troops of horses, they jump down from the chariots and fight on feet. Meanwhile the charioteers gradually withdraw from the battle and place their chariots thus that, if they (the men) would be oppressed by the multitude of the enemies, they would have an unimpeded retreat to their own [men]. Thus they exhibit mobility of horses and firmness of feet in battles, and so greatly by daily use and exercise they effect it that in declining and steep location, they are accustomed to control and direct with briefness and to check the excited horses, and both to run over through the pole and stand on the yoke, and to then recover themselves into the chariots most quickly.

[^4.27.1]: simul atque = simulatque = as soon as

4.34 With our [men] disturbed by which things because of the novelty of the battle, at the most opportune time Caesar brought help: and for the enemies halted because of his arrival, our [men] recovered themselves from [their] fear. And with this having been done, having judged that this time was unfavorable for attacking the enemy and for commencing battle, [Caesar] contains himself in his own position and with a brief time having passed between, he drew back [his] legions into the camps. While these things were being done, with all our [men] occupied, the remaining [Britons] who were in the fields departed. Storms follow for many continuous days, [storms] which both contain our [men] in the camps and prevented the enemy from battle. Meanwhile the barbarians sent out messengers into all parts and proclaimed to their own [men] the paucity of our soldiers and they explained how great a opportunity of taking spoils and liberating themselves into perpetuity was being given if they had expelled the Romans from the camps. Because of these things, with a great multitude of foot soldier and horseman gathered, they quickly advanced to the camps.

4.35 Caesar, even if he saw that that which had happened on previous days would [then] happen, [namely] that, if the enemies had been defeated, they would flee from danger with speed, nevertheless obtained around 30 horsemen, whom Commies Atrebas, about whom it was previously spoken, had transported with himself, [and] he established the legions in a battle-line before the camps. With the battle begun, the enemies were not able to bear the attack of our soldiers for too long and turned [their] backs. And [our men] followed them for as great distance as they were able to do with speed and strengths, and they killed many out of them, then with all buildings far and wide burnt, they recovered themselves into the camps.

4.36.1 That same day, legates sent by the enemies come to Caesar about peace.

5.24 With the ships drawn up, and with the council of the Gauls in Samarobriva finished, because in that year the grain grew rather narrow because of the droughts in Gaul, [Caesar] was forced, contrary to the previous years, to arrange the army in winter quarters and to divide the legions into many cities. Out of which, he gave one [legion] to Gaius Fabius to be lead against the Morini, another to Quintus Cicero against the Nervii, a third to Lucius Roscius against the Esubii; the fourth, he ordered to winter in the neighborhood of the Treveri with Titus Labienus in the Remi people. He arranged three [legions] in the Bellovaci: he placed the legates, quaestor Marcus Crassus and Lucius Munatius Plancus and Gaius Trebonius, in charge of these [legions]. He sent one legion, which he had enlisted recently across the Po, and five cohorts against the Eburones, the greatest part of whom is between the Mosa and Rine, [and] who were under the command of Ambiorix and Catuvolcus. He ordered the legates Quintus Titurius Sabinus and Lucius Aurunculeius Cotta to command these soldiers. In this manner, he estimated that he would easily be able to be cured of the grain insufficiency with the legions divided. And nevertheless the winter quarters of all these legions, except that which he gave to Lucius Roscius to be led into the quietest and most peaceful part, were contained by a hundred miles[^5.24.1]. He himself, meanwhile, until he had learned that the legions [had been] arranged and the winter quarters [had been] fortified, resolved to linger in Gaul.

[^5.24.1]: Lit: a hundred thousand of paces

5.25 Tasgetius had been born in the highest rank among the Carnutes, whose ancestors had held royal power in their own city. For him, Caesar, on behalf of his virtue and [his] kindness towards him [i.e. Caesar], because [Caesar] had used his remarkable service in all wars, had restored the status of the ancestors. [His] enemies, publicly and with many authors, had killed this [man], ruling now for the third year. This affair is reported to Caesar. He, having feared, because [the plot] concerned to many [peoples], that their city would revolt because of the instigation, orders Lucius Plancus to set out quickly against the Carnutes with a legion from Belgium, and to winter there, and to send to him those arrested by whose work he understood Tasgetius to be killed. Meanwhile, by all the legates and quaestors to whom he had entrusted legions, he was made more certain that it was arrived into the winter quarters and that the location for the winter quarters was fortified.

5.26 Within around 15 days, during which it was arrived into the winter quarters, the beginning of a hasty insurrection and revolt arose from Ambiorix and Catuvolcus; and who, although they had been at hand[^5.26.1] with Sabinus and Cotta at the borders of their own kingdom and had brought grain into the winter quarters, they, having been instigated by the messengers of the Treverian Indutiomarus, incited their own [people] and suddenly, with the wood-foragers oppressed, came to attack the camps with a great band [of men]. When our men had quickly seized arms and ascended the wall and with the Spanish horsemen sent from one part, had been superior in the equestrian battle, [and] with the state hopeless, the enemies drew back their [men] from the battle. Then in accordance with their own custom, they shout that someone from our [men] come forth to a conference: [they say that] they have [things] which they wished to say about the shared affair, with which things they hoped the dispute would be able to be settled.

[^5.26.1]: I.e. met Sabinus and Cotta

5.27 Sent to them for the purpose of talking is Gaius Arpineius, a Roman horseman [and] a close friend of Quintus Titurus, and [also sent is] a certain Quintus Junius from Spain, who now had been accustomed to visiting to Ambiorix before sent by Caesar; and with whom Ambiorix spoke in this way: [he said] that he confesses [that he] owed much to him on behalf of the kindnesses of Caesar towards himself, because by his effort, he was liberated from taxation, which he had been accustomed to pay to his own neighbors, the Aduatuci, and because both [his] son and the son of [his] brother had been sent to him by Caesar, [the sons] whom, having been sent among a number of hostages, the Aduatuci had held among themselves in servitude and chains; and [he said that] he had not done that which he did about the attack of the camps out of either his own will or judgement, but out of the compulsion of the population, and that his own authority was of such a kind that the multitude did not have less power in himself than he had in the multitude. Furthermore [he said that] this had been the cause of war for the population, because [it] was not able to resist the hasty plan of the Gauls. [He said that] he was able to easily demonstrate it from his own weakness, because he is not so inexperienced of things that he hopes that the Roman people is able to be overpowered by his own troops. But [he said] that this was a common plan of Gaul: that this day had been set for attacking all winter camps of Caesar, so that not any legion would be able to come for help for any other legion. [He said that] Gauls had not been able to easily deny Gauls, especially when a plan seemed to have been formed about recovering the liberty of the community. And because he satisfied them on behalf of [his] piety, [he said that] he now had reason of duty on account of Caesar's good deeds: [he says that] he warns [them], he begs Titurius on account of [his] hospitality to take care of his own safety and [the safety] of [his] soldiers. [He said] that a great hired band of Germans had crossed the Rhine; [and that] this [band] would arrive within two days. [He said that] this was their plan, whether they wanted before the neighbors perceive [it], to lead the soldiers having been led out from the winter camp either to Cicero or to Labienus, of which one [was away] by around fifty miles, the other [of which] was away from them by slightly further. [Ambiorix said] that he promised that [thing] and confirmed by an oath that [he] would give safe passage through the borders. And because [he] does this, that he both takes care for [his] city, because it will be lightened from the camps[^5.27.1], and that he returns a favor to Caesar for his services. With this address delivered, Ambiorix left.

[^5.27.1]: Romans leave $\therefore$ no more obligation to feed them

5.28 Arpineius and Iunius report [those] which they heard to the legates. They, disturbed by the hasty thing, even if these were said by an enemy, nevertheless estimated that [they] were not to be disregarded, and they were incited greatly by this thing, because it was hardly to be believed that the ignoble city and the lowly Eburones would dare[^5.28.1] to wage war with the Roman people by their own will. Therefore, they report the matter to the council and a great controversy ensued among them. Lucius Aurunculeius and a great many of the military tribune and the centurions of the first ranks estimated that [there was] nothing to be done rashly and that [it was] not to be departed from the winter quarters without a Caesar's order: they instructed even that however many great forces of the Germans could be sustained by the fortified winter quarters: [they said] that the matter was for proof[^5.28.2], because they sustained the first attack of the enemies the most bravely, moreover with many wounds inflicted: [they were] not oppressed by the grain situation; [they said] that reserve forces would arrive both from the nearest winter quarters and from Caesar: finally what was more inconstant or more dishonorable than to take an idea about the greatest things [of life and death] from an enemy authority?

[^5.28.1]: Semideponent verb: audeo audere ausus sum
[^5.28.2]: Dative of purpose

5.29 Against these [arguments] Titurius was shouting that they would do it too late, after the larger bands of enemies with Germans united had convened, or after some disaster[^5.29.1] had been accepted in the nearest wintering quarters. [He said] that the opportunity of debating [it] was short. [He said] that he thought that Caesar set out into Italy; [and that] otherwise the Carnutes would not have taken up the plan of killing Tasgetius, and nor would the Eburones be about to come to the camps with such great contempt of us. [He said] that [he] regarded not the enemy author, but the thing [itself]\: [he said] that the Rhine was close; the death of Ariovistus and our previous victories were a great pain for the Germans; reduced Gaul burned with so many injuries received under the rule of the Roman people, with [their] previous glory of  the military affair destroyed. Finally who would persuade himself with this, without certain proof, that Ambiorix had resorted to such a plan? His own opinion was safe in either part: if nothing was more serious, with no danger would they come to the nearest legion; if all Gaul were to combine with the Germans, the sole safety was placed on swiftness. Indeed what plan, of Cotta's and of those who disagreed, has an end?[^5.29.2] [The plan] in which, if danger [was] not present, but certainly starvation by a long siege would need to be feared.

[^5.29.1]: Partitive gen: lit. something of a disaster
[^5.29.2]: Rhetorical question = acc + inf (ind stmt) rather than subjunctive?

5.30 With this debate held into either part, because it was resisted fiercely by Cotta and the first rank [officers], "Y'all win," said Sabinus, "if you wish thusly," and [said] it with a clear voice, so that a great part of the soldiers heard: "I am no he," he said, "out of our men who most seriously is terrified by the danger of death: these [soldiers] will be wise; if something more serious happened, they will demand a reckoning from you, and they, should it be allowed through you, they, joined with the nearest winter quarters on the following day, will bear out the shared calamity of war with the remaining [soldiers], [and] nor would [they] perish either from fear or hunger, rejected and abandoned longe from the rest."

5.31 It is arisen from the council; [the soldiers] seize both and beg them to not lead the affair into the greatest danger by their own dissension and stubbornness: [they say] that the thing is easy, whether they should remain, or whether they should set out, if only they should feel and agree on one [plan]; on the other hand, in dissension they saw no safety. The affair is dragged into the middle of the night by the dispute. Finally Cotta gives [his] hands thoroughly moved: the opinion of Sabinus wins. It is proclaimed that they set out at first light. The remaining part of the night is consumed by wakefulnesses, because each soldier inspected [his] own things, what he would be able to carry with himself, what he would be forced to leave behind out of the toolkit of the winter quarters. Everything is thought out, why should they not stay without danger, and the danger would be augmented by the tiredness of the soldiers and by wakefulnesses. Thus, at first light, they set out from the camps with the longest column and with the greatest impediments, as [those] for whom the idea given was persuaded, not by an enemy, but the by the most friendly guy Ambiorix.

5.32 But the enemies, after they sensed about their departure from the nocturnal uproar and wakefulnesses, with ambushes placed in two parts in the woods in an opportune and hidden location, they awaited the arrival of the Romans from around two miles, and when the greater part of the column sent themselves down into the large valley, they suddenly show themselves from each part of that valley and began to oppress the newest [soldiers] and to prohibit the first [soldiers] from climbing up, and to join battle in the most inopportune place for our [men].

5.33 Then finally Sabinus, who had provided nothing before [this], [began] to shake (with fear) and to run about and to distribute the cohorts, however [he does] these things themselves timidly and as everything seemed to fail him; which was accustomed to happen to them very often, who is compelled to seize the idea in the business itself. But Cotta, who had considered that these [things] were able to happen on the journey and on that account had not been the author of the departure, failed in no thing of shared safety, and he excelled the [duty] of the commander in calling and encouraging the soldiers, and the duty of a soldier in battle. When, because of the length of the column, they less easily [were able] to attend to everything through themselves and to provide [that] which must be done in each location, they order [the officers] to announce that they abandon [their] impediments and take position into a ring. And even if the idea must not be criticized in such an accident, nevertheless it transpired inconveniently: for it both diminished the hope for our soldiers and rendered the enemies more eager towards battle, because it seemed [to be] done not without the greatest fear and desperation. Meanwhile that which was necessary to happen transpired, that soldiers everywhere departed from the standards, [that each] was hastening to seek and seize from [his] impediments those most precious things of theirs which each had, [and that] everything was filled with shouting and lamentation.

5.34 But the plan did not fail for the barbarians. For their leaders ordered [officers] to announce along the whole battle line, lest anyone depart from [their] place: the plunder was theirs and for them whatever things the Romans had abandoned were reserved: therefore they estimate that everything [was] positioned in victory. They were equals in both the strength and devotion of fighting; our men, although they were being deserted by [their] leader and by fortune, nevertheless they were placing all hope of safety in [their] strength, and as often as each cohort had charged, from that part a great number of enemies died. And with which thing noticed, Ambiorix orders [it] to be announced that they hurl weapons from far off, [that they] and not approach nearer, and [that they] retreat [from] the part into which the Romans made an attack (because of the lightness of arms and daily training nothing was able to be harmed for them), [and that they] again pursue themselves, recovering towards the standards.

5.35 And with which command obeyed by them the most diligently, when any cohort had withdrawn from the ring and made an attack, the enemies retreated the most rapidly. Meanwhile it was necessary that that part be exposed and that weapons be taken in from [their] open flank. When they had begun to turn back again into that location from which they had exited, they were surrounded by both those who had drawn back and by those who had stood nearest; but however were they wishing to hold the position, neither was a place left for valor, nor were the thick [soldiers] able to avoid the weapons thrown from such a great multitude. However having been distressed so much by disasters, with many wounds received, they resisted and with a great part of the day consumed, when it was fought from the first light to the eighth hour, they did nothing which was disgraceful to them. Then for Titus Blaventius, who had led the first century during the previous year, a brave man and of great authority, each thigh is pierced by a javelin; Quintus Lucanius, of the same rank, fighting the most bravely, while he helped [his] son having been surrounded, is killed; the legate Lucius Cotta, encouraging all the cohorts and ranks, is wounded by a slingshot directly in the face.

5.36 Having been moved by these things, Quintus Titurius Sabinus, when he had caught sight of Ambiorix far off animating his own [men], he sent his own interpreter Gnaeus Pompeius to him in order to ask that he spare himself and [his] soldiers. He, having been called, responded: if he should want to speak with himself, it was allowed; he hoped that that which pertains to the health of the soldiers was able to be obtained from the multitude; for [Sabinus] himself, truly nothing will be harmed, and into that thing he pledged his own faith. When he imparted [this] to wounded Cotta, that if it seemed [favorable], they withdraw from battle and speak with Ambiorix together: that he hoped from this to be able to obtain about his own [safety] and the safety of [his] soldiers. Cotta denied that he would go to an armed enemy, and in this he persevered.

5.37 Sabinus orders the tribunes of the soldiers and the centurions of the first ranks whom he had around himself in presence to follow himself and, when he had approached Ambiorix nearer, having been ordered to thrown down arms, did [that which was] commanded and orders his own [men] that they do the same. Meanwhile, while they carry on among themselves about the agreements, and a rather long conversation is prepared by Ambiorix with a decree, by degrees the surrounded [Sabinus] is killed. Then indeed in their own custom they proclaim victory and raise a howl and with an attack made against our [men], they disturb the ranks. There, Lucius Cotta is killed fighting [along] with the greatest part of the soldiers. The remaining ones recover themselves into the camps from which they departed. Out of whom the standard-bearer Lucius Petrosidius, when he was being pressed by a great multitude of enemies, cast the eagle within the wall; he himself, fighting the most bravely in front of the camps, is killed. They bear the assault into the night sickly; at night, with [their] health desperate, they all kill themselves to one [man]. A few, having slipped away from the battle, arrive with uncertain journeys through the forests towards the legate Titus Labienus into [his] winter quarters and make him more certain about the things done.

5.38 Elated by this victory, Ambiorix immediately sets out with the calvary against the Aduatuci, who were bordering with his kingdom; he neglects neither night nor day and orders the infantry to follow. With the affair explained and with the Aduataci incited, he arrived against the Nervios on the next day and exhorts [them] to not let pass an opportunity of freeing themselves into eternity and of taking vengeance on the Romans for these injuries which they accepted: he declares two legates were killed, and that a great part of the army perished; [he says that] there was nothing of concern that the oppressed legion, which winters with Cicero, is suddenly killed; he offers himself as the assistant to that task. With this speech, he easily persuades the Nervii.

5.39 And thus, with the messengers sent off at once to the Ceutrones, the Grudii, the Levaci, the Pleumoxii, and the Geidumni, who are all under their command, they gather the greatest possible bands they can and unexpectedly rush towards the winter quarters of Cicero, with the report about the death of Titurius not yet conveyed to him. To him, that which was necessary happened-- that some soldiers, who had departed into the forests with the reason of wood-gathering and fortifications, were intercepted by the sudden arrival of the horsemen. With them surrounded by a great band, the Eburones, the Nervii, the Aduatuci, and all of their allies and vassals began to attack the legion. Our [men] quickly rush to arms, [and] mount the rampart. This day was sustained with difficulty, because the enemies were placing all hope into [their] speed, and they were confident that [should] they gain this victory, they would be victorious into perpetuity.

5.40 Immediately letters are sent by Cicero to Caesar, with great rewards put forth if they should have delivered [them]: with all roads obstructed, the [letters] sent are intercepted. At night, from the material which they had collected for the reason of fortification, fully 120 towers are constructed with incredible speed; those [things] which seemed to be lacking to the work are finished. On the following day, the enemies attack the camps with much larger [forces] gathered, [and] they fill the ditch. With the same manner with which it [was resisted] on the day before, it is resisted by our [men]. This same [thing] is done successfully on the remaining days. No part of the night time is neglected towards labor; the opportunity of quiet is given not to the sick, and not to the wounded. Whatever things are necessary towards the assault of the nearest day; many stakes are burnt, a great number of wall spears[^5.40.1] is constructed; the towers are built up, the feathers and armors are woven from wickerwork. Cicero himself, although he was with most tenuous health, was not even leaving night time to quiet for himself, that moreover he was compelled by the gathering and the voices of [his] soldiers to spare himself.

[^5.40.1]: I.E. the spears for throwing from on top of the words

5.41 Then the leaders and chiefs of the Nervii, who had another approach of conversation and reason of friendship with Cicero, say that they wish to speak. With that possibility granted, they mention the same [things] which Ambiorix had done with Sabinus: that all Gaul is in arms; that the Germans have crossed the Rhine; and that the winter quarters of Caesar and of the remaining [soldiers] are being attacked. They add even about the death of Sabinus: they show Ambiorix with the reason of making a pledge. They say that they are mistaken if they were to hope for any help from them, who are despairing in their own matters; however they are of this mind towards Cicero and the Roman population, that they object to nothing except the winter quarters, and [that they] do not want this custom to become established: [they say] that it is allowed for them to depart, unharmed, through themselves from the winter quarters, and [that it is allowed for them] to set out without fear into whatever parts they want. Cicero responds to these [things] in one way: the custom of the Roman people was not to accept a condition from an armed enemy: if they should wish to lay down from arms, they would use themselves as an assistant, and [they] would send legates to Caesar; [they say that] they hope that [the Nervii] will persuade on behalf of the justice of him (Caesar), which they sought.

5.42 Having been driven back from this hope, the Nervii surround the winter quarters with a wall of 9 feet and with a ditch of 15 feet. They both had learned these [things] from our [men] with the customs of the previous years, and [they] were taught by those whom they held as captives secretly from the army; but with no supplies of iron tools which were suitable to this use, they were seen to cut around the turf with swords, [and] to drain out the ground with hands and military cloaks. And from this thing indeed it was able to be learned about the multitude of the men: for within less than three hours, they finished a fortification of 15 miles in circumference, and with the remaining days they began to make and prepare turrets towards the height of the rampart, hooks and testudos, which the same captives had taught.

5.43 On the seventh day of fighting, with the greatest wind having arisen, they began to throw red-hot slugs from molten clay and heated spears from slings into the huts, which on account of the Gallic custom were covered with straws. These quickly caught fire, and the wind, because of [their] magnitude, scattered [the fire] into every location of the camps. The enemies, with a great clamor as if with victory now obtained and secured, began to drive the towers and testudos and ascend the rampart with ladders. But there was such great virtue of the soldiers and such presence of mind, that, although on all sides they were scorched by flame, and they were  pressed by the greatest multitude of weapons, and they understood that all their own luggage and all fortunes burned, not only did nobody descend from the rampart for the cause of deserting, but nearly not any person indeed did look back, and all [men] fought most bravely and sharply. This day was by far the most serious for our [men]; but however it had this consequence, that the greatest number of enemies were wounded and killed on this day, as they had crowded themselves under that wall, and last ones were not giving a retreat to the first ones. Indeed with the flame having been paused slightly, and with the turrets thrust in a certain location and touching the wall, the centurions of the third cohort retired from that location which they were standing and removed all their own [men], and began to call the enemies, with a nod and with voices, if they wished to enter; of which, nobody dared to advance. Then, they were driven off with stones hurled from every part, and the tower was burnt.

5.44 There win in that legion the bravest men, centurions, who were approaching the first ranks, Titus Pullo and Lucius Vorenus. They were having eternal controversies among themselves, who would be preferred, and on all years they contended for the positions with the greatest jealousy. From them Pullo, when it was fought most sharply at the fortifications, "why do you hesitate," he said, "Vorenus? Or what opportunity of proving your virtue do you expect? This day will judge about our controversies." When he had said these, he proceeds outside the fortifications and bursts into the part of the enemies which seemed to be most dense. And indeed, nor did Vorenus contain himself then within the wall, but he, fearing the judgement of all the [men], follows. With an average space left, Pullo directs [his] javelin into the enemies and pierced a running one out of the multitude; and with which [soldier] struck and unconscious, they protect this [one] with shields, together they throw weapons into [their] enemy (Pullo) and do not give an opportunity of retreating. The shield for Pullo is pierced and a spear is stuck in [his] sword-belt. This misfortune turns [his] sheath and delays [the] right hand for [the one] trying to draw [his] sword, and the enemies surround the impeded [Pullo]. The rival Vorenus runs to help him, and aided the laboring one. The whole multitude immediately turns itself to this [man] away from Pullo: they judge that he (Pullo) was killed by the spear. Vorenus carries on the fight with a sword hand-to-hand, and with one killed, drives back the rest slightly; while he presses on more eagerly, he, having been cast down into the lower place, falls down. To him having been surrounded, Pullo in turn brings help, and with a great many [men] killed, both [men] uninjured receive themselves within the fortifications with the greatest praise. Thus fortune turns to both in battle and [in] contest, such that one rival was of help and safety for the other, and nor was it able to be decided which [of the two] seemed to be preferred over the other with respect to virtue.

5.45 By as much more serious and more violent the assault was day by day, and because with the greatest part of soldiers finished off by wounds, the situation had arrived to a paucity of defenders, by the same degree more frequent were letters and messages being sent to Caesar;  of which, a part, having been captured in the sight of our soldiers, was killed with torture. Within, there was one Nervian, Vertico by name, born from an honest standing, who had taken refuge the first siege to Cicero, and he had exhibited his own faith to him. He persuades the slave with the home of freedom and great rewards, that he bring back the letters to Caesar. He brings out the these [letters] bound into a javelin, and the Gaul among the Gauls, having been dealt with without any suspicion, came to Caesar. From him it is learned about the dangers of Cicero and [his] legion.

5.46 Caesar, with the letters received around the 11th our of the day, immediately sends a messenger into the Bellovaci to the quaestor Marcus Crassus, whose winter quarters were absent from him by 25 miles; he orders the legion to set out in the middle of the night and to come to him quickly. Crassus departs with the messenger. [Caesar] sends another [messenger] to the legate Gaius Fabius, so that he should lead a legion to the borders of the Atrebatians, at which [place] he knew that the journey was to be made by him. He writes to Labienus, if he were able to make for the advantage for the state, [he] should come with a legion to the borders of the Nervii. He does not think that the remaining part of the army was to be expected, because they were slightly further [away]; he collects around four hundred horsemen from the nearest winter camps.

5.47 On around the third hour, having been made more certain from the forerunners about the arrival of Crassus, he proceeds on that day 20 miles. He puts Crassus in command of Samarobriva, and he assigned a legion, because there the he had abandoned the impediments of the army, the hostages of the citizens, the public letters, and all the grain, which he had carried for that reason of enduring winter. Fabius, as he had been commanded, thus having not delayed much, meets with the legion in the journey. Labienus, with the slaughter of Sabinus and the murder of the cohorts known, when all the supplies of the Treveri had come to him, fearing that, if he had made a departure similar to flight from the winter camps, he would not be able to bear an attack of the enemies, especially [those] whom he knew were carried away by the recent victory, sends back to Caesar letters with how much danger he would lead the legion out of the winter camps; He reports the matter having been done among the Eburones; he informs [him] that all the troops of the calvalry and the infantry of the Treveri had taken position three miles away from his own camps.

5.48 Caesar, with his idea considered, even if disappointed by the expectation of three legions, returns to two, however he was placing the one help of shared safety in speed. He came into the borders of Nervii with great journeys (forced marches). There he learned from the captives what things were being done among Cicero, and in how much danger the situation was. Then he persuades a certain person from the Gallic calvary-men, with great rewards to bear a letter to Cicero. He sends this [letter], written with Greek letters, so that our plans would not be learned by the enemy with the letter intercepted. If he should not be able to approach, he advises [him] that he hurl a spear with the letter fastened to the strap into the fortification of the camps. In the letters he writes that he, having set out quickly with the legions, was about to be present; he exhorts [him] that he retain [his] former virtue. The Gaul, fearing the danger, as he had been commanded, sends the spear. This sticks to the tower by chance, and not noticed by our [men] for two days, on the third day it is spotted by a certain soldiers, [and] having been removed, it is brought to Cicero. That man reads out the [letter] having been read through in an assembly of soldiers, and he inspires all [men] with the greatest happiness. Then, smokes of fires were seen far off; and which thing expelled all doubt of the arrival of the legions.

### Seneca the Elder: The Murder of Cicero
> Marcus Cicero, sub adventu triumvirorum, cesserat urbe, pro certo habens, id quod erat, non magis Antonio eripi se, quam Caesari Cassium et Brutum posse. Primo in Tusculanum fugit; inde transversis itineribus in Formianum, ab Cajeta navem conscensurus, proficiscitur.
> Unde aliquotiens in altum provectum cum modo venti adversi rettulissent, modo ipse jactationem navis, caeco volvente fluctu, pati non posset, taedium tandem eum et fugae et vitae cepit, regressusque ad superiorem villam, quae paulo plus mille

**Translation**

Marcus Cicero, before the advent of the (2nd) triumvirs, had proceeded from the city, thinking [it] for certain, that which was, that he himself would not be snatched from Antony more than Cassius and Brutus would be able [to be snatched] from Caesar.First he fled into Tusculum; then on cross-country roads into Formia, about to embark a ship from Cajeta, he sets out.
From there, several times when hostile winds had brought [him] having set out into the deep [ocean] back, he was not able to bear the tossing of the ship,..., at last boredom of both escape and life took him, and having returned to the higher house, which is away from the sea slightly more than a thousand paces (1 mile): "Let me die," he said. "In the fatherland having by saved by me often."
It is agreed enough that the slaves had been faithfully and bravely prepared to fight;
that he had ordered that the litter be put down, and that the quiet [slaves] carry [him] which asdfasd.f... The head was cut off for the one leaning forward from the litter and quietly offering his neck. Nor was that enough for the unfeeling cruelty of the soldiers: they cut off his sands also, reproaching that they had written something against Antony.
Thus the head was carried back to Antony, and with his order [the head] was placed between the two hands in the Rostra, where he as consul, where often as proconsul, where that very year he [spoke] against Antony, as no human voice ever [had spoken], when he had been heard because of admiration of eloquence. Scarcely were the men lifting [their] eyes able to look on his cut off limbs before tears.
He lived for 63 years, so that if [his] strength had been absent, so that death is not possible indeed to seem immature.

77. The neighboring cervius[?]

Once, a country mouse was brought to receive a city mouse in a poor cave, the aged host, rough and attentive to supplies, [received] the aged friend, although he relaxed his frugal spirit for friendships. Why [say] much? And he neither begrudged [him] of the chickpea selected nor of the long oat, and carrying it in his mouth, he gave dry grape seed and half-eaten morsels of lard, wanting to conquer with a varied dinner the disgusts of the one hardly touching things one by one with haughty tooth, while the father of the house himself, stretched out on the fresh hay, ate the spelt and darnel, giving up the better things of a banquet. Finally the city mouse said to him "friend, what pleases you to live here in the back, suffering from the rough woodland? Why don't you put humans and cities in front of forests and savages? Seize the way, trust me, comrade, because earthly things allot souls to mortals, nor is there any escape from death either in full or in part: therefore, good one, while it is allowed, live blessed in happy things, live mindful of how you are of a short life."

97. ... When these words
98. propelled forth the peasant, he leapt free from [his] house; then
99. both completed the proposed journey, and faring well,
100. they crept under the walls of the nocturnal city. And now
101. the night held the middle space of the sky, when each placed
102. footprints in the opulent house, where garments dyed


106. Therefore when he placed the stretched-out peasant in purple garment,
107. just like a short-jacketed waiter the host scurried about
108. and continued the feast lest he not fulfill those duties[^108]
109. in a slave-like fashion, pre-licking everything that he brought forth.
110. Reclining, he rejoiced because of changed fortune and 
111. acts as a happy guest because of the good things, when suddenly
112. a huge clamor of the doors shook off both from the couch.
113. Terrified they ran through the entire room, and greatly
114. breathless they trembled, likewise the tall house rung out 
115. with Molossian dogs. Then the country mouse said: "Hardly
116. is life here beneficial to me. Goodbye: the forest and cave,
117. safe from attacks, will console me with thin vetch."

244. in front, and in a large column the crowd which follows
245. oppresses the loins; this man strikes with his elbow, another strikes with a
246. hard pole, but this one strikes against my head a tree trunk, another a 
247. liquid measure. Legs fertile with dirt, I am soon trampled from all sides
248. by a great heel, and a soldier's spike sticks in the toe for me.
249. Now look at the other and diverse dangers of the night:
250. What distance is there from lofty roofs, from where a clay shard
251. will hit your head, how many vases, cracked and cut short,

254. and thoughtless of sudden death, if you should go to dinner
255. without a will: I approach such fates, how many windows lie open

# Petronius (Feb 2024)
## Cena Trimalchionis

27. ... Nor was the slave further chasing after those which had touched the ground, but he had a full back and was supplying for those playing. And now we observe these strange things. For two eunuchs were standing in a different part of the circle, of which one was holding a silver chamber-pot, and the other was counting balls, indeed not those balls which the men shook between their hands in a driving game, but those which had fallen onto the ground. Therefore as we admired these luxuries, Menelaus ran up and said "He is the one at whose house you will place an elbow, and indeed you will now see the beginning of the dinner." Menelaus spoke no longer as Trimalchio snapped his fingers, at which signal the eunuch placed the chamber pot under the playing man. With his bladder unloaded, he demanded water for his hands, and he wiped his fingers, having been sprinkled, in the hair of a boy. 
28. It was a long time to pick up the single balls. Therefore we entered the bath, and at this moment of time, having been made hot by sweat, we exited to the cold room. Now Trimalchio, soaked with perfume, was wiped clean not with napkins but with cloaks made from the softest wool. Meanwhile three masseurs were drinking Falernum in his sight, and when they, quarrelling, had poured out too much, Trimalchio declared that they had drank to his own health with this. Hence, having been wrapped in a scarlet cloak, he was placed on the litter, with four medalled runners preceding him and a hand-drawn cart, in which his favorites were carried, a poor old boy, bleary-eyed, uglier than his master Trimalchio. Therefore as he was carried away, a musician with the smallest flutes approached towards his head and just as if he were whispering something in secret into the wind, he sang for the entire journey. We followed, now filled with admiration, and we arrived to the door with Agamemnon, in whose post there was a little notice fixed with this inscription: "Whatever slave should exit the doors without the order of the master, receives 100 strikes." However in that entrance itself stood a doorman wearing leek-green, wrapped up in a cherry-color belt, and he was cleaning the pea in the silver platter. But above the threshold hung a golden cage, in which a spotted magpie greeted those entering.

29. ... Moreover a slave market had been pictured with a notice, and long-haired Trimalchio himself was holding the herald's staff, and with Minerva leading he was entering Rome. Thence the careful painter had diligently rendered everything with an inscription: how Trimalchio had learned to keep accounts, and finally was made an accountant. Now indeed in the portico giving out, Mercury grabbed him on the chin into a lofty raised platform. Fortune was ready with an overflowing plentiful horn, and so were three Fates twisting golden wool threads. I even noticed a group of runners in the portico, exercising themselves with their master. Besides, I saw a huge chest in the corner, in whose shrine the silver Lares had been placed, and there was a marble statue of Venus and a small box-- golden, and not very small-- in which they say his beard had been stored up. Thus I began to ask the house-manager what paintings they had in the middle. "[We have] the Illiad and the Odyssey," he said. "and Laenas's gladiator show." It was not allowed for me to consider the details of the paintings...
30. We now had arrived at the dining room, in the first part of which the overseer took accounts. And as for that which I especially admired, in the doorposts of the dining room the fasces had been fastened with axes, one part of which he ended as if it were the bronze bow of a ship, on which it was written: "I, Cinnamus, am given to Gaius Pompeius Trimalchio, an Augustan sevir." Under that same title, both a two-lighted lamp hung about the vaulted ceiling, and two tablets were fixed on each post, of which one, if I remember well, had this inscription: "On the third day and on the day before the Kalends of January, our Gaius dines outdoors," the other of which had the course of the moon and seven painted images of the stars; and the days which are lucky and those which are unfavorable were noted on a separate knob. ..... But as we moved our right step together, a slave, having been stripped, fell prostrate at the feet for us and began to ask that we save him from punishment: he said that his sin was not great, because of which he was in peril; for the clothes of the treasurer had been stolen from him in the bath, which was hardly worth ten sesterii. Therefore we took back our right feet, and we begged to the accountant counting gold in the atrium that he take back the punishment from the slave. Haughty, he lifted his face and "The loss does not move me" he said "as much as the carelessness of the most useless slave. He ruined my dinner clothes, which a certain client had gifted to me for my birthday, Tyrian no doubt, but already washed once. Why is that then? I give him to you." 
31. Having been obliged with such a great service, when we entered the dining room, the same slave himself ran up to us, for whom we had asked, and planted the thickest kisses on those standing agape, thanking us for our kindness.  "You will know in short," he said, "to whom you gave kindness. The favor of a waiter is the master's wine." Therefore finally we reclined with Alexandrian boys pouring water cooled with snow into our hands, and with others following at our feet and lifting toenails with great care. And not even were they silent in this so annoying task, but they sang in passing. I wanted to find out if the whole family would sing, and so I demanded a drink. The boy at the ready welcomed me with a not less bitter song, and whoever had been asked to give something. You would believe that this was the chorus of a pantomime, not the dining room of the paterfamilias. The appetizer was carried in, having been washed thoroughly; for now everyone had reclined, except Trimalchio himself, for whom the for place was saved according to a strange custom. But a Corinthian bronze donkey had been placed on the appetizer tray with a pair of saddle-bags, which had in one part white olives, in another black. Two platters covered the ass, on the border of which the name of Trimalchio and the weight of the silver was written. Even little bridges having been glued up held the dormice scattered with honey and poppy-seed. There were both sizzling sausages placed above the silver grill, and below the grill there were Syrian prunes with seeds of Punic pomegranate.

### A: Trimalchio's Tomb pg. 289
Trimalchio said "Freinds, even slaves are humans and equally, they drank the same milk (lactem = lac), even if evil fate (malum fatum) will have oppressed them. However, with me living, soon they will taste the free water. Ultimately (to the highest point), I free all of them from my hand (command) in my will. And for this reason I publicize everything, so that my family may love me now already thusly just as if [I were] dead."

All began to give thanks to the kindness of the master, when he, forgetful of trifles (getting down to business), ordered a copy of the will to be brought forth and recited the whole from beginning to end with the family groaning. Finally looking back at Habinnas, "What do you say," he said. "my dearest friend? Have you built my tomb, as I ordered you? I ask you urgently, that the besides the feet of my statue, you paint a puppy and wreaths and oils and all the battles of Petraites (gladiator), so that it happens for me to live after death on account of your kindness; besides, [i ask] that there be 100 feet in width, and 200 feet in depth. For I want [it to be that] every type (of) fruit tree be around my ashes, and in abundance of grape vines. For it is very wrong indeed that there be cultivated homes for the living and that they (the homes) are not cared for. And for this reason before everything I wish to be added: 'Let this monument not follow the heir'"

### B. More about the tomb pg. 291
"I ask you that you even make in my tomb ships going with full sails, and me sitting in the tribunal (platform) wearing the toga praetexta with five golden rings and pouring out money in public from a little sack; for you know that I gave a feast at two denarios each. Let it be made, if it seems to you, even a dining room. You should even make the entire population making sweetly to themselves. At my right, you should put a statue of my Fortunata holding a dove, and she leads a puppy bound by a leash, and my little pet (slave?), and copious gypsum-covered jars, lest they spill wine. It is even allowed that you sculpt a broken urn, and above that a crying boy. [You may place] a sundail in the middle, so that whoever will inspect the hours, whether he wants to or not, may read my name.

"Also see carefully if this inscription seems suitable enough to you: Gaius Pompeius Trimalchio Maecenatianus rests here. For him, absent, the office of sevir was assigned. Although he was able to be in all boards of Rome, nevertheless he refused. Pious (devoted, holy, devout, respectful, good), firm (strong, brave, courageous, mighty, vigorous, steadfast, powerful), and devoted (reliable, constant), he grew from little, he gave up 30 million sisterces, and he did not ever hear a philosopher. Goodbye. 'And you'" As he said this, Trimalchio began to cry abundantly. Even Fortunata was crying, and Habinas was crying, and finally the entire family, just as if [they were] asked in a funeral, filled the dining room with lamentations.

### C Millionaires Autobiography pg. 293
"But as I had begun to say, my frugality guided me towards this fortune. I came from Asia as big as this lampstand is. Ultimately, every day I was accustomed to be measured against it, and so that I might rather quickly have a bearded chin, I smeared my lips about the lamp.  Moreover, just as the gods wish, I was made master in the house, and behold! I took the brain of the man himself. Why [say] many things? He made me coheir with Caesar, and I accepted a broad-striped (fit for a senator) inheritance. However, nothing is enough for nobody. I longed to go into business. Lest I delay y'all with many [words], I built five ships, I loaded wime-- and besides, it was equal to it's weight in gold-- and i sent it to Rome. You would think that I had ordered it; all the ships were shipwrecked, a fact, not a story! In one day Neptune wasted 30 million sesterces. Do yall think that I faltered? No, by hercules; for me this loss was worth a tiny bit, just as if nothing happened. I made the rest bigger and better and happier, so that nobody would say that I [am] not a brave man. Y'all know, a big ship has great strength. Again I loaded wine, lard, bean, perfume, and slave. At this point Fortunata did a devout thing; for she sold all her gold, all [her] clothes, and for me she put 100 aureos in hand. This was the leavening of my savings. Soon it happened, because the gods wished it. In one journey I rounded off 10 million sesterces. At once I bought back all the farms which had been my patron's. I build a house, I buy up slaves and mules; whatever I touched, grew just like honey."

### A. Midas chooses a gift pg 263
For him the god, rejoicing on account of the guardian recovered, gave the choice, pleasing but useless, of a gift to be chosen. He, about to use the gifts badly, said 'make it that, whatever i will have touched with [my] body, should turn into yellow gold.' Liber (bacchus) nodded to the wishes and granted the gifts about to harm, and felt sorry, because he had not sought better [things]. The happy Berecynthian hero leaves and rejoices on account of the evil [wish], and tests the fidelity of the promise by touching several [things], and hardly trusting himself, he drew down a green branch from a not-tall holm-oak: The branch was made gold; from the ground he takes a rock: the rock also grew yellow with gold; and he touches a lump of earth: the lump becomes a nugget because of the powerful touch; he plucked the dry ears (grain) of Ceres: the harvest was gold; he holds a fruit taken from the tree: You would think that the Hesperides had given it; if he moved his fingers to high doorposts, the posts seemed to shine; Even when he had washed his hands with clear waves, the wave flowing from his hands was able to mock Danaen; He himself only just catches his own hope in his mind, imagining everything as gold. The rejoicing servants placed the tables piled up with banquets lest [they be] lacking of tosted grain (bread).

**Translation and notes**

The god, rejoicing on account of guardian (being) reclaimed[^A1], made for him a choice, pleasing but useless, of choosing a gift (of a gift to be chosen). That man, about to use the gifts badly, said "Make it so (that), whatever I will have touched with (my) body, may be turned into yellow gold." Bacchus nodded to the wishes and granted the gifts about to harm and felt sorry, because he (Midas) had not sought better. The happy Berecynthian hero leaves and rejoices because of the evil and tests the honesty of the promise by touching several (things), and barely trusting himself, pulled down a branch green with foliage from a not high holm-oak: the branch was made gold; he lifted from the ground a rock: the rock also grew yellow with gold; and he touched a lump of earth: with the powerful touch the earth became a nugget; he plucked drying ears (of grain) of Ceres: the harvest was gold; he holds a fruit taken from the tree: you would think that the Hesperides gave (them); if he moved (his) fingers to tall doorposts, the doorposts seem to shine. When he had washed ~~(dirt) from his hands~~ his hands with clear waves, the wave flowing from his palms was able to mock even Danae; He himself, imagining everything gold, only just took hold of his own hope with (his) mind. For the one rejoicing, the servants placed tables filled with feasts and not lacking of toasted grain (i.e. bread).

**Translation & Notes**

Then in truth, if he had touched the gifts of Ceres with (his) right (hand), the gifts of Ceres stiffened, or if he prepared to tear at the feasts with greedy tooth, a yellow film covered the feasts with the tooth having been drawn near; He had mixed the author of the gift (Bacchus = wine) with pure waves: You would see that liquid gold flowed through (his) teeth (lit. smiles). Astonished by the novelty of the evil, both rich and wretched, he chooses to escape riches and hates (those) which he had recently wished for. No abundance relieves hunger; the throat of dry thirst burns, and the deserved is tortured by jealous gold, and lifting hands and great arms to the sky, he says "Give forgiveness, Lenaeus father ('lord of the wine press')! We (I) have sinned, but have pity, I pray, and snatch (me) away (i.e. save) from (this) outwardly beautiful injury." The will of gods being gentle, Bacchus restored the one confessing to have sinned and undid, with faith of the agreement, the gifts given. And (ve??) he said "Lest you remain covered with gold badly wished for, go to the river near great Sardis, and struggling along the mountain-ridge, exposed to slipping waves, pick a path, until you come to the source of the river, and submerge (give under) at the same time your hand and body in the foamy spring, and likewise wash clean the crime." The king advanced to the ordered waters: the power tinted the river gold and fell from the human body into the river; now also today the paling lands are stiff on account of the golden seed of the ancient artery begun with the wet clods.

**Translation**

The judgement and opinion of sacred mountain (Tmolus) was pleasing for all, however it is proven and called unjust by the word of one Midas; and Delian (Apollo) did not allow the stupid ears to retain the human form, but he drags [the ears] into space (i.e. makes them long) and fills [it] with white hairs, and he makes the bottoms unstable and gives [it] so that they are able to be moved: The rest are of human, he is condemned in one part, and he put on the ears[^C1] of a slowly walking donkey. Indeed, he wants to hide [theears], and he tries to relieve foreheads from disgraceful shame by means of purples caps; but the servant, accustomed to trim long hairs with iron, had seen this. And he, and although he did not dare to betray this shame seen, wanting to take it off under the breezes, however, he was not able keep silent, he departed to the ground and dug [it] up, and he reported back with small voice what kind of ears of the master he had seen, and to the earth dug up he murmurs, and he hides the evidence of his own voice with the earth thrown back and silent, he departed from the ditch filled in. And a thick grove with trembling reeds began to grow there and as soon as it ripened in a full year, it betrayed the planter: for, having been moved by slow south wind, it brought forth the buried words of the master and revealed the ears.

## D. Daedalus Fashions Wings
Meanwhile, Daedalus, having been hated Crete and long exile, touched by love of [his] birthplace, had been blocked by sea. "It is allowed [that] he blocks the earth and waves: But the sky certainly lies open; We will go that way: He may possess all, [but] Minos does not possess the air." He said and sends forth his mind into unknown arts and makes nature new. For he put feathers in a row having been begun from the smallest, with the small following the long[^D2] , so that you would think them to have been created on a slope: Thus sometimes a rustic panpipe grows little by little with uneven reeds. Then with string he binds together the middle, and with wax [he binds] the bottom, and thus he binds slightly ....

**Translation & Notes**

He instructs the son and says "I warn [you] that you hurry in the middle path, Icarus, lest if you will go too low, the wave would weigh down the feathers, if too high, the heat will scorch: Fly between both. And I order you not to look at Boötes or the Great Bear and the drawn sword of Orion: With me as the leader, seize the way!" At the same time he hands down the rules of flying and he fits the unknown wings to the shoulders. Between the work and warnings, the old man's cheeks became wet, and the father's hands trembled; he gave kisses not to be repeated again to his own son, and suspended by the wings he flies in front, and he fears for the comrade, just as a winged [bird] which from a high nest leads forth the tender offspring into the air, and he urges [him] to follow and teaches the destructive arts and he himself moves his own [wings] and looks back at the wings of the son. 
While someone captures fish with trembling reeds, or the shpherd leaning on the stick or the plowman [leaning on] the handle saw them and was amazed, and trusted those who were able to seize the air to be gods. 

## F. The Fate of Icarus
**Latin pg. 281**
1. They were flying between Samos and Lebinthos, and they had already flown past Delos and Paros
2. Icarus "coepit gaudere volatu audaci": Began to rejoice on account of bold flight. He stops following Daedalus and stars to fly higher.
3. The heat of the sun melts the wax binding the feathers together.
4. Icarus is unable to catch any air with his bare arms and falls.
5. He calls his father's name as he falls into the water. 
6. Daedalus is "infelix"
7. Daedalus calls for Icarus when he realizes he is gone
8. Daedalus sees the feathers in the waves of the sea
9. He curses his own unnatural art
10. Both the sea into which he fell and the land where he is buried are named after Icarus.

**Prep Vocab**
audax, audacis (adj): bold
aspicio, aspicere, aspexi: to look at, to observe 

**Translation**
And now Juno's Samos was on the left side (Both Delos and Paros had been left behind), and on the right side were Lebinthos and Calymne fertile with honey (abl of specification). When the boy began to rejoice on account of bold flight and deserted the leader and, dragged by eagerness of sky, made a higher journey. The nearness of the scorching sun softens the pleasant-smelling wax, the bonds of the feathers; the waxes had disintegrated: He flaps bare arms, and lacking an oar (ablative of separation), he catches not any breezes, and the mouths, shouting the name "father," are received by the sky-blue water, which took the name from him. But the unlucky father, and not a father now, said, "Icarus." He said "Icarus, where are you? In what region should I seek you?" He was saying "Icarus:" he caught sight of feathers in the waves and cursed his own arts and buried the corpse in a tomb, and the land was called by the name of the buried.

> Trimalchio: "Amici,"" inquit, "et servi homines sunt et aeque unum ==lactem==[^A1] biberunt, etiam si illos ==malus fatus==[^A2] oppresserit. Tamen me salvo cito aquam liberam gustabunt. Ad summam, omnes illos in testamento meo manu mitto. Et haec ideo omnia publico, ut familia mea iam nunc sic me amet tanquam mortuum".
Gratias agere omnes indulgentiae coeperant domini, cum ille oblitus nugarum exemplar testamenti iussit afferri et totum a primo ad ultimum ingemescente familia recitavit. Respiciens deinde Habinnam: "Quid dicis, inquit, amice carissime? Aedificas monumentum meum quemadmodum te iussi? Valde te rogo, ut secundum pedes statuae meae catellam pingas et coronas et unguenta et Petraitis omnes pugnas, ut mihi contingat tuo beneficio post mortem vivere; praeterea ut sint in fronte pedes centum, in agrum pedes ducenti. Omne genus enim poma volo sint circa cineres meos, et vinearum largiter. Valde enim falsum est vivo quidem domos cultas esse, non curari eas, ubi diutius nobis habitandum est. Et ideo ante omnia adici volo: HOC MONUMENTUM HEREDEM NON SEQUATUR

**Translation & Notes**

Trimalchio said "Friends, even slaves are people, and equally they drank the same milk, even if hostile fate has oppressed them. However, with me living, soon they will taste the freedom-water. Ultimately (to the highest point), I send all those from my power in my will. And I publicize these things for this reason that my family may already now love me thus just as if [I was] dead." 
All began to give thanks to the kindness of the master, when he, forgetful of trifles (getting down to business), ordered a copy of the will to be brought forth and recited the entirety from beginning to end with the family groaning. Finally, looking back at Habinnas, [Trimalchio] said "What do you say, O dearest friend? Have you built my monument as I ordered you? I ask you strongly, that you paint a puppy and wreaths and oils and all battles of Petraitem next to the feet of my statue, so that it may befall me to live after death because of your kindness; furthermore [I ask] that there would be 100 feet in front, 200 feet in the ==back?.== For I wish [that] every fruit-tree type be near my ashes, and ==greatly of vines.?==  For it is very wrong indeed that homes are elegant for the living, and that they are not cared for where we must live (it is to be lived by us) for longer. And for this reason before everything I wish to be added: THIS MONUMENT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE HEIR"

15. Scaurus loved the house (he preferred to live nowhere else?) despite having a family house at the sea?

Agrippam nihilo tractabiliorem, immo in dies amentiorem, in insulam transportavit saepsitque insuper custodia militum. Cavit etiam senatus consulto ut eodem loci in perpetuum contineretur.  Atque ad omnem et eius et Iuliarum mentionem ingemiscens proclamare etiam solebat:

**neptis, neptis, fem**: granddaughter

**Translation & Notes**
He took away the use of wine and all rather luxurious refinement from the relegated [Julia], and he did not allow [her] to be approached by any child or slave, unless with him consulted, and such that he became more certain (become informed) with what age, what stature, and what color he (the suitor) was, even with what birthmarks or scars. After a quinquennium he finally transferred her from an island into the mainland with slightly less severe conditions. For he was in no way able to be entreated to recall [her back to Rome] entirely, having called down in the public assembly [the curse of] such daughters and such spouses upon the Roman population often pleading and persisting rather insistently. He forbade the baby born from the granddaughter Julia after [her] condemnation [from] being fed or being recognized. He transported Agrippa, by no means more manageable-- rather, into days (day by day) more insane--, into an island and confined [him] furthermore with the custody of soldiers. He even ordered with the decree of the senate that he be confined in the same of place forever (in perpetuum). And, groaning [Augustus] was even accustomed to proclaiming "I wish I had remained unmarried and had died without offspring" at all mention of both him (Agrippa) and the Julias, and [he was accustomed] to not calling them differently than three of his sores and three of his cancerous ulcers.

# TESTAMENTUM PORCELLI (Apr 2022)

**Latin**

>  Incipit testamentum porcelli: M. Grunnius Corocotta porcellus testamentum fecit. Quoniam manu mea scribere non potui, scribendum dictavi.
> 
> Magirus cocus dixit: "veni huc, eversor domi, solivertiator, fugitive porcelle, et hodie tibi dirimo vitam". Corocotta porcellus dixit: "si qua feci, si qua peccavi, si qua vascella pedibus meis confregi, rogo, domine cocu, vitam peto, concede roganti". Magirus cocus dixit: "transi, puer, affer mihi de cocina cultrum, ut hunc porcellum faciam cruentum". Porcellus comprehenditur a famulis, ductus sub die XVI Kal. Lucerninas, ubi abundant cymae, Clibanato et Piperato consulibus. Et ut vidit se moriturum esse, horae spatium petiit et cocum rogavit, ut testamentum facere posset. Clamavit ad se suos parentes, ut de cibariis suis aliquid dimittere eis. Qui ait:
>
>  Patri meo Verrino Lardino do lego dari glandis modios XXX, et matri meae Veturinae Scrofae do lego dari Laconicae siliginis modios XL, et sorori meae Quirinae, in cuius votum interesse non potui, do lego dari hordei modios XXX. Et de meis visceribus dabo donabo sutoribus saetas, rix[at]oribus capitinas, surdis auriculas, causidicis et verbosis linguam, buculariis intestina, esiciariis femora, mulieribus lumbulos, pueris vesicam, puellis caudam, cinaedis musculos, cursoribus et venatoribus talos, latronibus ungulas. Et nec nominando coco legato[^1] dimitto popiam et pistillum, quae mecum attuleram; de Theveste usque ad Tergeste liget sibi colum de reste. Et volo mihi fieri monumentum ex litteris aureis scriptum: "M.GRUNNIUS COROCOTTA PORCELLUS VIXIT ANNIS DCCCC.XC.VIIII.S(EMIS). QUODSI SEMIS VIXISSET, MILLE ANNOS IMPLESSET". Optimi amatores vei vel consules vitae, rogo vos ut cum corpore meo bene faciatis, bene condiatis de boni condimentis nuclei, piperis et mellis, ut nomen meum in sempiternum nominetur. Mei domini vel consobrini mei, qui testamento meo interfuistis, iubete signari".

**Translation & Notes**
sperasti = speravisti
"Traitor, have you hoped to be able to cover up such crimes and, silent, to flee my land? Do neither our love, nor the right hand formerly pledged, nor Dido about to die with cruel funeral hold you? In fact, are you even building a fleet during winter constellation, and are you preparing to go through the deep [ocean] during the middle of the north wind? Why, if you were not seeking alien lands and unknown homes, and if ancient Troy were to remain, is Troy laid open to fleets through the wavy sea? Do you flee me? I beg you, through these tears and your right [hand] (since I myself left nothing else to miserable me now), through our marriage, through weddings begun, if I earned something well from you, or [if] anything of mine was sweet to you, take pity on the falling house, and if there is any place here for prayers, put aside that plan. Because of you, the Libyan nations and rulers of Numidians hate [me], the Tyrians [are] hostile; because of the same you, and [my] sense of honor [is] extinguished, and prior reputation, by which alone I was going to the stars, [is extinguished]. For whom do desert dying me, guest (since this name only remains from "husband")? Why do I delay? Until either my brother Pygmalion destroys the walls, or the Gaetulian Iarbas leads captured [me]? At least, if some offspring had been begotten for me from you before [your] escape, if some small Aeneas, who nevertheless would bring you back with [his] face, would play in the palace for me, I would not seem entirely deceived and deserted entirely."

dum /w subjunctive = "until", dum /w indicative = "while"

**Translation & Notes**

She had said. Because of the warnings of Jupiter, he himself was holding eyes unmoving and struggling, he pressed care under [his] heart. Finally he replies little [words]: "I will never deny that you deserve the many things you are able to count by speaking, nor will it pain me to remember Elissa (i.e. Dido) while I myself [am] remembering of myself, while [my] spirit rules these limbs. Let me say a few [things] for [this] case. I neither hoped to conceal this escape with deception (do not think [this]), nor did I ever extend the torches of the spouse, nor did I come into these agreements. If the fates were to allow me to lead life with my [own] auspices and to organize matters with my [own] will, I would be caring for the city Troy first and the sweet leftovers (relics, remains) of my [people], the tall roofs of Priam would remain, and by hand, I would have established (placed) a restored Pergama (citadel of Troy) for the vanquished (trojans). But now Apollo of Grynium [ordered me to make for] great Italy, and the Lycian oracles ordered [me] to make for Italy; this [is my] love, this is [my] fatherland. If the citadels of Carthage and the sight of the Libyan city holds back you, a Phoenician, what hatred is there that the Trojans settle [in] Ausonian [land]? It is proper that we seek foreign kingdoms. The troubled ghost of [my] father Anchises, whenever night covers the lands with moist clouds, whenever fiery stars shine, warns me in dreams and terrifies me; [my] boy Ascanius and injury of a dear head [warns/terrifies] me, "
