# 9-10 Summer

## Wed 2022-05-04
Starting this journal. How should I organize this?

Today was AP day for APCSDS. Really easy. Wonder if I have a chance for a perfect score? I almost failed at reading comprehension on FRQ (free response questions) a few times. That one question said to replace one half of the input with the string "\*\*\*", but I almost did it so that half of the string was replaced with "\*". Gotta pay attention I guess.

Maybe asking Datar to do FindAuthor in Rust?

Varun made plans to form a musical group with Agastya, Atharv, and me. "Ode to Joy quartet." He says:
> 1. shitpost: atharv cello, grant clarinet, agastya piano, varun violin
> 2. shitpost but better: atharv violin, varun cello (the only skill), grant clarinet, agastya piano
> 3. jazz with some shitpost: atharv sax, varun double bass, grant clarinet, agastya piano.
> 4. jazz but with skill: atharv sax, varun cello, grant piano, agastya trumpet

Planning to bring clarinet tmrw and having varun cram it into his locker. His clothes are still in my locker...

Should I pick up clarinet? Cello? Still have no clue for summer
- *Clarinet Progress Log*
    - Scuffed "Let it Go" & "Small world after all"
        - With both fingerings for the high B, C, & D
    - White notes from A3 => D5 fingerings mostly memorized.
        - Also $\text{F4}\sharp$ and $\text{B4}\flat$ for some reason

I should stop procrastinating. Crazy Brave reading is due tmrw. I feel my work ethic is gone. Severe senioritis, where's that motivation? Used to have so much drive to do things. Energy???

Arrgh capstone and personal narrative. Is the personal narrative not the same thing as the reflection?

Hating history.

Gaahhh math test tmrw. Matrices. Taught like shit. Why the fuck would you teach how to do the mindless calculations over what they actually mean? Computers exist! Calculators exist! Inverses and determinants, multiplication. Bad. Why didn't we cover transposition even?

Hating history.
Giving up and submitting digital notes
What's the fucking point of writing out notes
Why do I feel so bad about missing the A+ in rim?

Update on math test: Goof'd on multiple choice

Varun's bday party tmrw. Still don't know what I'm gonna get him.

Capstone

Datar wants me to do bitwise. She did allow me to do FindAuthor in rust.

I feel like I'm caring about grades a lot more... Whyyyyyyyyyy
This is bad
I don't like thinking about this

If Gen Xers are the bosses now, they are the bosses only in a very Gen X way: ambivalently, fleetingly and with dubious authority.

In 1984, Sugio Hayama, a biologist at Kyoto University, videotaped the inside of a chimpanzee’s throat to study its reflexes under anesthesia.

god fucking damnit fix your schedule

### Gotta go so much bigger
- Commit big
- Stop overthinking, talking yourself out
- Get out of your comfort zone
    - Feeling of belonging: Must overcome to reach belonging
- A small hiccup seems like the end of the world afterwards

### Progress is being made
- Tangible, granular, actionable goals
    - Big goals too daunting, no idea of where to start
- Expectations for where I should be. What are they?
- Where are the indicators?
- Feelings: No progress, going too slowly, falling behind


# 10th Grade
## Sun 2023-01-15
It is the week after performing in SDS (I was Freddy in Picasso at the Lapin Agile. Stupid fucking haircut, but whatever).
Right now I'm writing at 1:21 AM. Listening to Billy Joel, Glass Houses.
Throwback to last summer I guess? Staying up till 4 am listening to billy joel or safety third or ajr. aahhhhhhh

Semester 1 just ended. How? What?

Still feeling the same as end of 9th grade. I don't know, feels like I focus so much better at this late time at night. During the day I just can't and just spend all my time on YouTube. What am i doing. Kinda feeling directionless.

"All for Leyna" + 2 am vibe feeling super nostalgic. oh god also + wikipedia to complete it.

Mom's college friends' daughter had come over winter break. Never learned what her english name is? I had ditched last minute to go on a ski trip to Heavenly with Dad. Break just disappeared with me doing nothing. IDK. Strange 2 weeks.

Jason is going out with Melody, very wild. Will just avoid that ig.


##### Morning/Afternoon: 2:31 PM
Woke up at like 11, listening to rubber soul rn has heavy quarantine/virtual school vibes.

# 10-11 summer
### Mon 2023-06-12

It is now 2 weeks into summer vacation, well technically 1 week? I had no finals so it was basically 2 weeks.

Since last time, I'm now listening to way too much Radiohead. When did I first listen to Kid A? Seems like time flew past. "Pakt like sardines in a crushd tin box from Amnesiac." I'm a reasonable man, get off my case.

I do have things to look forward to, even if it doesn't feel like. Link crew next year. Academics editor for the yearbook. Auditioning for a new musical or play perhaps? Do I want to do robotics maybe? I don't know. This year it fell apart after FLL and ditching for SDS. Not important, seems like too much time/effort for literally nothing. I just remember being made to de-burr random shit and organize the lab even though I had no clue where anything went.

Just moved my school 10 folder into the archives folder. It was meant to be only for semester 1 but I never made a 2nd one for semester 2.

10th grade felt wild.

"Pyramid song"

It was a weird year, and it just felt like a slog for the last few months, which is way too long in retrospect. Gilbert did not teach during Euro, AP classroom videos were less than useless, I think they actually contribute negative knowledge. Chem went at a snail's pace: every. single. lab. was a titration. why? At least we did cover electrolysis. Study of music was endless lecturing, none of which I have retained. Prokofiev, Beethoven, Handel's water music? idk. AP calc was also pretty boring, who the fuck cares about the volume of a vase? I put like minimal effort into that project, but the MM2 project before that about numerical integration was pretty decent. I guess I didn't see a way to explore on the volume one since it was more applied, engineering-like than the others. Ig I don't really like engineering, since it's just learning endless tools to apply mindlessly. Still remember doing $$\int {e^{\cos x}\,dx}=\frac{-e^{\cos x}}{\sin{x}}$$ on the ap. Why do i still remember that dumb mistake? AP scores coming out next month, ig we'll see. I'm hoping for 5s on everything except probably Euro. Anyways, english essays were the hardest part of this year for some reason. ehhhhhh. [nyt article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/25/smarter-living/why-you-procrastinate-it-has-nothing-to-do-with-self-control.html). AP latin was way too much translation and not enough new material. We didn't even finish the last unit of vergil by the time of the AP, but I just translated through it by myself as study. The passage about Aeneas watching Charon (which we actually did reach in class) appeared on the AP so that was cool.

Of all my APs, Euro was the only one i really sweat studied, but I'm not confident at that one. I never really learned how to do the SAQs and DBQs properly, and I really needed to do that. I NEED to figure it out for APUSH next year. I still don't know exactly how to respond to the prompts in what to say and my examples are always somewhat off, but maybe that's ok. Maybe history is really just about being able to bs something plausible, and I'm just not comfortable with that yet.

Not too enthused about driving or SAT right now.

I am looking forward to next year though. I should organize my hard drive. Should I be saying SSD now? lmao.

Friday/Saturday (haven't slept yet)

I had ideas and can't sleep. Submission for SoME3 (August Deadline)
1. "$e^x$ explained backwards": Derive exp() from diffeq by building the taylor series.

Thursday July 20

Taking photos at fringe tech tmrw. Feeling silly about it?

Feeling anxious/not being able to relax: Feeling of "i don't know what i'm doing" or "i'm not doing the best/right thing?" No motivation to do things?
Afraid of not knowing how to proceed?
Time management/goal setting: If I have a clear goal/vision/something I want to do & think is worthwhile, I can see a clear path forward to getting it done. However, with hurshman essays & this stuff I have no idea and get decision paralysis.

Self-doubt/judgement/criticism: Always second guessing.

I think I'm going to commit to journaling every day of my senior year. Just record every little thing so I can look back on it one day, and force myself to remember and think about everything. Right now I feel like I've failed this summer too, but rationally I am not failing in the slightest.

Volunteer hours can wait (realistically) and are fixable.
I can still schedule a random dance class for DB. Hopefully Jason is still down. Very excited about that for next year yet still somewhat nervous.
I'm not behind on college research, I am very much still on track.
Learning to drive can wait. It's a distraction, I need to figure out this other shit first.

I'm leaving tomorrow to tour schools on the east coast with my dad, and after that I will tour california schools with mom on a road trip. Priority one will probably be scheduling that dance class for DB cause that's the easiest thing. I will message Jason about it on discord tomorrow after we land? First time I have downtime on the east coast.

Maybe I should try to meet up with Varun Thvar, he's at RSI right now.

Priority two will be doing more college research and starting to gather writing prompts and thinking. I need a more structured and clear goal than that if I'm gonna get myself to do it but yeah.

I'm on track. I'm objectively doing fine, but it does not feel that way.

Got back from my trip to the east coast last sunday (after our delta flight was fucked by the Crowdstrike outage). Kinda mixed feelings about the trip. We did accomplish what we set out to do, saw book of mormon and had some fun.

Prolly gonna pretend to do the dance thing at One Studios (https://ononestudios.com/sign-up/, https://ononestudios.com/dance-classes/choreography/)

## 2024-08-20
2nd day of senior year is over, and I just chatted over Discord with Varun for a bit.

My takeaway was I dont really have a goal for myself. Where do I want to be in 20 years? I don't see a space for myself to be comfortable and authentic, I can't really even imagine what it would be like. Thinking about it, I feel that Harker has made me really cynical of STEM, maybe even of people in general. Consciously, I want to believe. I want to believe that people, or the world is fundamentally good. But the everyday experience I live, of people collegemaxxing, and not really knowing what to do with myself?

These past two days I just felt unease, even as I was hanging out with my friends. It will be over soon, so will I be able to find a place and purpose for myself, wherever I end up 1, 4, 10, or even 20 years from now? Mr. Hurshman talked about this as Eudaimonia. I should consider more: what exactly are my values? What are harker's stated vs. real values? My friend group? Maybe I should do the essays he was talking about.

Looking at myself, I realize my usual response to pressure has been to avoid it and pivot to something where I felt I had control. The mere existence of a necessity or pressure to perform saps away my motivation, and it becomes a game of try not to fall down, not of be your best self in any way. Looking at the outcome, I think I've become numb as a coping mechanism. I've learned to say "I don't care" to almost anything, and it's so self-destructive.

A great source of pressure for me has been a sense of responsibility: to my parents, to the people around me? But it also feels like a pressure to conform and just figure everything out, and it kind of self-perpetuates. How can I focus on bettering my community when I feel like a shitbag?
